I would start taking estroblock Pro asap and just take two pills in the morning. I would also incorporate maca and vitex into your diet as well. Another thing- start upping your healthy fat intake to help get your hormones under control. This includes grassfed butter or ghee, high quality meats like grassfed lamb, beef, etc (if you eat meat) avocado, coconut oil, MCT oil or brain octane oil from the Bulletproof Executive (be very careful with how much MCT oil you take off the bat, it can cause serious stomach issues if you take too much).

<h1>Sources of Live Cephalopods</h1>
<strong>The purpose of this list:</strong> 
<br><br>
UPDATE: TONMO.com keeps the most recent information on current suppliers of cephalopods.
<br><br>
This list is designed for use by scientists, educators and hobbyists wishing to purchase live cephalopods. <b> Please note: There are two tables:&nbsp;one for hobbyists and one for scientists. The sources listed in the scientist table <em>only</em> supply to educational or research institutions.</b> &nbsp;Really. <em>Please </em>don't bother them with your requests.<br><br><strong>Keeping a Pet Cephalopod:</strong>
<p>I entertain several gazilion emails a week asking for information about keeping cephalopods in a home aquarium, yet this topic has been well covered within the hallowed halls of <a href="/">The Cephalopod Page</a>. While I LOVE questions about hobby-level ceph husbandry, I am not so keen on being asked to rewrite what's already published here. Please do your own research first - then <script>var ml="jamesbwood2000";var mr="yahoo.com";var ma="@";document.write("<A HREF=\"mailto:"+ml+ma+mr+"\">email Dr. Wood</a>")</script>!</p>

<p><strong>The Cephalopod Page's Advice:</strong> 
<br><br>
Usually, hobbyists interested in keeping a pet cephalopod (you should stick with Octopus or Cuttlefish - Squid don't survive well in aquaria) should first consider buying one at their local aquarium store. Even if they don't regularly stock cephalopods, most good saltwater shops can special order an octopus (and in rare cases, a cuttlefish) if it is requested. The main advantage one gains by going through a pet store is in cost&mdash;and it's a big difference. Because pet stores buy through distributors and in bulk quantities, a cephalopod at the local shop will cost nearly <em><strong>half</strong></em> of what it would to get through the mail: overnight shipping is <strong>expensive </strong>and saltwater is heavy; not to mention if the shipment has to cross a national border and become mired in red-tape permits and government bureaucrats that think cuttlefish are fish and octopuses are not because the word fish is not part of their name. Although some retailers will require a deposit to cover their risk, another advantage to the consumer lies in the fact that you normally get to examine the animal and ask the shop owners and caretakers questions about it before you make it your pet. 
<br><br>
<strong>Here's The Caveat</strong>:</p>
<p><u><em><strong>Most</strong></em> shop owners lack specific knowledge about cephalopods, their care requirements, and species information</u>.&nbsp;The online shops and mail-order houses are usually no better about it. In fact, most of what the industry knows about cephs is from trial-and-error and long-standing rumors&mdash;rumors that don't favor our soft friends. Many will slap the omnipresent <em><a href="/Octopusvulgaris.php">O. vulgaris</a></em> or <em>O. joubini</em> tag on their animal and sell it as such, regardless of where it came from or what it actually is. The animal you receive could be a baby with the potential to grow very large, or it could be&nbsp;a full grown adult of a small species that may have only weeks left in it's natural lifespan. It has been my experience that most octopuses in the aquarium trade are in the small to medium size range as adults&mdash;rarely larger than a grapefruit. Both scientists and hobbyists alike find frustration in finding transportation for their cephalopods, and international orders will need to address permits to cross national borders. In addition to costing more than many marine fish and invertebrates, none of the cephalopod family tolerate shipping stresses well, and there's always the chance of inking during shipment. I'm told that almost any other type of cargo has higher priority than live fish and invertebrates, and some of the species listed below are only available in certain seasons. Also, the prices below do not include shipping costs&mdash;which can be over $50 for the smallest specimens and thousands for the largest. The Cephalopod Page is not affiliated with any of the suppliers on these tables. If you have any specific questions, please contact the supplier. Prices and availability are always subject to change.<br><br>
The Cephalopod Page encourages you to seek out captive-raised animals whenever possible. Supporting the effort for farm-raised cephalopods not only negates the impact on the environment, but it almost ensures that you will get a young, healthy cephalopod without any question of species.<br><br>
<strong>The Blue Ringed Octopus Issue</strong><br><br>
Members of the family <em><a href="/bluering1.php">Hapalochlaena</a></em> display stunning arrays of coloration, which have earned them a nearly universally known moniker: Blue Ringed Octopuses. Like many beautiful fish in the sea, the spectacular patterning of this small octopus means the Blue Ring is prized and popular among hobbyists and aquarists alike. Unfortunately, it is not well known that these tiny cephalopods pack a very potent venomous bite that earns them a spot among <u><strong><em>the most dangerous creatures on Earth</em></strong></u>. Their venom, a potent neurotoxin called tetradotoxin, (abbreviated: TTX) is one of the few known cephalopod venoms that can affect humans, but the effect is drastic. Even in the minuscule doses delivered by a Blue Ring's nearly unnoticeable bite, TTX can completely shut down the nervous system of a large person in just minutes&mdash;the risk of death is very high. If the danger level is not a deterrent enough, members of <em>Hapalochlaena</em> are notoriously difficult to keep&mdash;they require very picky water quality issues, they are very shy and short-lived animals: often the animal you get from a pet shop or mail-order company is already 4-5 months old&mdash;not a good investment for a mollusk with a 6 month life span. Finally, Blue Ringed Octopuses don't wear their spectacular coloration all the time&mdash;only when they are extremely agitated. I can guarantee that teasing and annoying a Blue Ring on a regular basis will kill one of you prematurely&mdash;either the octopus from stress, or you after receiving a defensive bite.
<br><br>
The risk associated with keeping Blue Ring Octopuses, plus their short life span and challenging water requirements earns them a spot high on the list of the worst cephalopodpets one can choose. <a href="/bluering1.php"> For more information, please refer to our  article about Blue Ring Octopuses.</a> 
<br><br>
The Cephalopod Page does NOT recommend keeping Blue Ringed Octopuses for anyone but researchers and those who are experienced with venomous animals.</p>
<p><strong>On Exotic Species, especially the Mimic Octopus</strong></p>
<p>Through television specials and documentaries The Discovery Channel it's ilk have brought some absolutely incredible cephalopods into the living rooms of the everyday family. These wonderous creatures feature vibrant coloration and behaviors so astounding that even the top scientists of the world are continually amazed. All of this is packaged into unquestionably the coolest class in the animal kingdom: the cephalopods. <a href="http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=260" target="_blank">The Mimic Octopus</a> has gained fame from clips of video showing it performing convincing imitations of sea snakes, flounders, lionfish and other odd sea creatures. Metasepia cuttlefish are known as flamboyant cuttlefish due to their spectacular coloration. Naturally, excited aquarists eager to keep one of these creatures in their own tanks have begun putting pressure on suppliers to find them, and many are willing to pay dearly for one. Mimic Octopus and Metasepia are extremely cool. Trying to get one of your very own is not cool.</p>
<p>Folks, simply put, these species are quite rare. Scientists spend weeks trying to find a single specimen to photograph and study. Five minutes of video footage shown on the TV specials can easily represent months in the ocean trying to locate a single animal. The trouble is, the collection divers native to these exotic oceans are better at finding them&mdash;especially if collectors are paying top dollar for them. With the species in question already being scarce and the bounty-driven locals catching every one they can find to be boxed up and shipped to America, the road to extinction will be a very very short drive for these incredible cephalopods. Here's the other side of the coin. Gang, they're still cephalopods&mdash;the most delicate of hobbyist-keepable sea life. Imagine how you'd ache after a 20 hour flight home from Indonesia. Now imagine making the trip in a gallon of water in a sealed bag. Truth is, most cephalopods&mdash;Mimics, Flamboyants, or anything from the opposite side of the world, die in transit. By most, I mean almost 100%. They lack the constitution to make the trip. This is the reason you don't see many Indonesian and Australian cephalopods gracing pet stores or online catalogs. Every once in a while however, one makes it.</p>
<p>I know a couple people who obtained a mimic octopus or a close relative including TCP's Dad, Dr. Wood. Therein lies the flipside to these marvelous animals: in the home aquarium Mimic Octopuses are VERY difficult to care for, and they don't display any of their famous mimic behaviors. In capitivity, they lead a life of stress and fear, never acclimating to their owners like bimacs or vulgaris' do. They feed only reluctantly and one must wait until the wee hours of the night to ever see their pet. Cuttlefish are the kings of skittish sea life, and many species are just NOT right for an aquarium. Contained in glass, they are doomed to slam into aquarium sides at cuttlefish warp speed every time a light comes on, a person looks into the tank, the cat walks by, etc. Their death will be slow and agonizing, as the wounds from slamming the glass (we call it <em>Butt Burn</em>) eventually infect and takes the life of the cuttlefish. It isn't fair to the animal when there are so many better cephalopod pets.</p>
<p>In response to this trend, The Cephalopod Page urges hobbyists to be responsible to the environment: please resist the temptation to seek out Mimic Octopuses and their exotic brethren and leave these incredible animals to nature, and nature specials.</p>
<p>Now, without further ado...</p>

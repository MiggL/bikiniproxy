<p>The two resignations hours apart sparked a discussion on Twitter about African leaders&#8217; penchant to hang on to power despite pressure to resign from their citizens.</p>
<p>Some shared a photo of President Uhuru Kenyatta meeting with the two former leaders.</p>
<p>A cheeky tweep suggested Kenyans could donate one of their presidents (Raila or Uhuru) to countries experiencing presidential vacuum.</p>
<p>Here are some of the reactions.</p>

<p>The wives were discussing how mpango wa kandos should keep off as their men would be busy the whole day.</p>
<p>Some wives were however sure their men would ignore them this Valentine&#8217;s in preference to mistresses.</p>
<p>The debate eventually turned to who, between the wife and mistress, deserves a treat during Valentine’s Day.</p>
<p>Here are some of the sentiments shared on the group.</p>
<p>“Today not the best day to take your mpango wa kando (mwk) for a date. Very risky. First wives wako keen today like no other day,” one wife wrote.</p>
<p>“Kama kuna mtu nangoja wangu asahau niko na yeye leo in fact atanikuta kwa gate ya job na mngoja leo kamutu ameumia,” another added.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGE OF DIET</strong></p>
<p>“Calm your titties and go to work. Mzee atakuja tu. Change of diet is good, you should try it too,” one retorted.</p>
<p>“The fact remains that your man is a cheat. If he can leave you and go take mwk out on Val&#8217;s day, it means wewe hauko. Mwk is special whether being used or not,” another commented.</p>
<p>“Mwenye atapelekwa out leo ndiye special so watch your space and know your position,” another advised.</p>
<p>“Yaani am here stressed up coz wangu amechukua off we spend the day together and I had my own plans and you are there complaining of who is special than the other,” another wondered.</p>
<p>“Learn to love yourself more and such nonsense will never bother you,” one wrote.</p>

<p>South African lawmakers on Thursday selected Cyril Ramaphosa as the country&#8217;s new president after scandal-tainted Jacob Zuma resigned under pressure from his own ANC ruling party.</p>
<p>Ramaphosa was chosen without a vote after being the only candidate nominated, chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng told assembled lawmakers at a special sitting of the parliament in Cape Town.</p>
<p>The announcement brought loud cheers from ANC lawmakers, with Ramaphosa due to address the parliament later during proceedings.</p>
<p>Zuma resigned on Wednesday as the ANC finally turned against him after a nine-year reign dominated by corruption scandals, economic slowdown and plummeting electoral popularity.</p>
<p>Zuma railed against the ANC for &#8220;recalling&#8221; him from office and — when he at first refused to resign — then threatening to oust him via a parliament no-confidence vote.</p>
<p>In an earlier TV interview on Wednesday, Zuma said he had received &#8220;very unfair&#8221; treatment from the party that he joined in 1959 and in which he had fought for decades against apartheid white-minority rule.</p>
<p>Zuma had been in a power struggle with Ramaphosa, his deputy president.</p>
<p>Zuma&#8217;s hold over the ANC was broken in December when his chosen successor — his former wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma — narrowly lost to Ramaphosa in a vote to become the new party leader.</p>

<p>Dennis Murimi Wachira rose to fame on September 1, 2017 after he managed to breach presidential security detail during Mr Kenyatta&#8217;s campaign stopover on Jogoo Road to have an up close interaction with him.</p>
<p>The twenty one year-old hawker shook hands with the then Jubilee presidential candidate, held a brief chat and even offered him a ‘small’ token.</p>
<p>He is a familiar face to commuters who use matatus plying the Jogoo Road route</p>
<p>Mr Murimi, who hawks sweets and chewing gum, claims President Kenyatta had told him &#8220;unitafute&#8221;.</p>
<p>Four months after the promise, he has been ‘searching’ for the president quite literally.</p>
<p>“He told me to look for him after winning the election, I am doing just that,” he told <em>Nairobi News</em> during an interview.</p>
<p><strong>POUR OUT HIS HEART</strong></p>
<p>Mr Murimi hopes the president will honour his promise so that he can pour out his heart to him.</p>
<p>“I just do not want to meet him, I want to request for a job, any job, as long as it is stable and I am able to cater for my needs and those of my family. I don&#8217;t mind being a sweeper at State House,” he told <em>Nairobi News.</em></p>
<p>On the day of their meeting, just like the Biblical Zacchaeus who climbed a sycamore tree to see Jesus and in turn got the surprise of his lifetime, Mr Murimi shouted when the president was passing by, “Mr President may I sell PK to you?” he said.</p>
<p>Despite the crowd and mean-looking bodyguards all around, the president summoned him to his vehicle as he addressed a crowd at Burma market.</p>
<p>He gave the president two sachets of chewing gum worth sh40.</p>

<p>“I do not know whether he heard me but I requested from him a chance to work for Kenya Defence Forces. It does not matter what position, even if I will work in the mess, I will appreciate,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr Murimi is however aware of his shortcoming. “I have a condition that I developed while in standard six,” he said.</p>
<p>He developed incessant headaches while at school and a medical checkup revealed that he had hydrocephalus (water in the brain) and had to undergo surgery at Kenyatta National Hospital.</p>
<p>To date, he still has a shunt tube, a device that drains water from the brain to his stomach, which was inserted in his body to control the condition.</p>
<p>Due to the condition, he developed epilepsy while in Form Two at Highlink Secondary School, Nairobi.</p>
<p>“For one year now I have not been epileptic. I believe it is favour from God,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>NOT DOING WELL</strong></p>
<p>He said business is not doing well.</p>
<p>“We depend on traffic jam to sell, but, there is no jam along the road because the Outer Ring Road is already operational. Sometimes conductors do not allow us to get inside the vehicles,” he said.</p>
<p>On a good day he gets sh500, which he uses to restock sweets and chewing gum and help his family of six.</p>
<p>He tried to join National Youth Service (NYS) but was unlucky after being told he could not make it.</p>
<p>“I was disappointed, because all my life I have wanted to give service to my nation.”</p>
<p>Just like the numerous young jobless people in the country, he hopes his cry will reach the highest office.</p>

<p>The annual lovers’ day is often characterised with flowers, love making and creating impressions. We revisit all these aspects in our stock taking.</p>
<p><strong>1. Relationships were redefined</strong><br />
It was a day to determine one’s true position in a relationship. So some lovers scored highly while others were quickly dumped for showing no effort.</p>
<p>Many unmarried couples take this day to determine if their partners are the real deal or they are just but side dishes. Some relationships ended yesterday while others were taken to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>2. Babies were made</strong><br />
A joke has been doing rounds on social media that if sex involved gunshots, Wednesday night would have mimicked a world war. The day was characterized by some merry making and all we can do is wait till November to see the fruits of what transpired.</p>
<p><strong>3. Money was spent</strong><br />
All the gifting that comes with Valentine’s Day ensures a bumper harvest for businesspeople. Those selling any acceptable gifts and most notably the creative Kenyans who offered their delivery services at vendors’ kiosks made a kill.</p>
<p><strong>4. Flowers withered</strong><br />
With all the hype to have flowers delivered, some of the roses have now withered and what is even sad is that some bunches are already trashed. Even those that preserved the roses in their vases, the clock is ticking and soon they too shall wither well good thing is, the impression of love was made after all.</p>
<p><strong>5. Men breathed</strong><br />
The pressure on men to impress on this day was real and much as it is called lovers day, maybe it should become ladies day. The men had to choose what flowers to send and the perfect gift that would make their women feel loved and all that pressure is now gone.</p>

<p>Sources within the team confirmed this development, adding that the player&#8217;s decision has already taken effect.</p>
<p>She will consequently not be available for selection for the forthcoming World Championship games slated for Japan in September.</p>
<p>Kenya have been pooled alongside Kazakhstan, Brazil, Puerto Rico, Serbia and the Dominican Republic in the competition.</p>
<p>Brackides has been  one of the outstanding players of her generation. Besides enjoying stints with clubs in Japan and France, she bagged several individual and team continental honours during her decade old stint with the national team.</p>
<p>She also captained the team for three years before handing the reins to current skipper Mercy Moim.</p>
<p>She will be remembered for her outspoken nature, and specifically for the outburst with the Kenya Volleyball Federation officials in 2015, which led to her temporary exclusion from the team.</p>

<p>While giving the ruling on Thursday, Justice Luka Kimaru declared that Miguna&#8217;s deportation had no merit in law.</p>
<p>The judge directed the government to deposit Dr Miguna’s revoked passport at the court within seven days.</p>
<p>In a quick response to the judgement, the self-declared National Resistance Movement general said they will use lawful means in their campaign.</p>

RIGHT: US President Donald Trump. PHOTOS | AFP" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;" srcset="http://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Untitled-1-5-300x200.jpg 300w, http://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Untitled-1-5.jpg 524w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px" /><p>An American porn star who claims to have had an affair with Donald Trump before he became president now feels free to tell her story, her manager said Wednesday.</p>
<p>After Trump&#8217;s longtime personal lawyer admitted paying $130,000 to Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election, the actress&#8217;s manager suggested a non-disclosure agreement had been broken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is off now, and Stormy is going to tell her story,&#8221; manager Gina Rodriguez told US media.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s aide and special counsel Michael Cohen has refused to say why he paid Daniels the vast sum but was not, as he claims, reimbursed by the &#8220;Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump declined to comment on the issue. The White House has dodged questions about whether allegations of an affair are true, claiming the matter was dealt with during the campaign.</p>
<p>It has also referred any questions about the payment to Cohen.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;BASELESS ALLEGATIONS&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Vice President Mike Pence described suggestions of an affair as &#8220;the latest baseless allegations against the president.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, celebrity magazine <em>In Touch</em> published a 2011 interview with Daniels &#8211; whose real name is Stephanie Clifford &#8211; in which she details having &#8220;textbook generic&#8221; sex with Trump.</p>
<p>She recalled meeting Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in 2006, shortly after the president&#8217;s wife Melania Trump gave birth to their son Barron.</p>
<p>Since the alleged signing of a confidentiality agreement, Daniels has denied the affair took place and then appeared to deny making the denial.</p>
<p>The allegations bubbled away before the election but have resurfaced because of a legal case that claims Cohen&#8217;s payment may have broken campaign finance laws.</p>
<p>The lawyer said he did nothing wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;The payment to Ms Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone,&#8221; Cohen said.</p>
<p>He declined to say whether Trump was aware of the payment.</p>
<p>Watchdog group Common Cause launched the legal action, saying they have &#8220;reason to believe&#8221; that money was &#8220;an unreported in-kind expenditure&#8230; because the funds were paid for the purpose of influencing the 2016 presidential general.&#8221;</p>
<p>The alleged violation of federal campaign finance law &#8220;undermines the integrity of democracy in the United States,&#8221; a letter signed by Paul Ryan of Common Cause reads.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;MAKE AMERICA HORNY AGAIN&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Daniels has been taking advantage of her newfound notoriety.</p>
<p>Last month, she appeared at the Trophy Club strip club in South Carolina as part of a &#8220;<em>Make America Horny Again</em>&#8221; tour &#8211; a tongue-in-cheek- reference to Trump&#8217;s &#8220;<em>Make America Great Again</em>&#8221; campaign slogan &#8212; that will also reportedly take her to several other states over the next few months.</p>
<p>In a recent appearance on the late night TV talk show &#8220;<em>Jimmy Kimmel Live</em>&#8221; &#8211; right after Trump delivered his State of the Union address &#8211; Daniels deflected questions about the alleged affair and whether she had signed a non-disclosure agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t say whether you have a non-disclosure agreement. But if you didn&#8217;t have a non-disclosure agreement, you most certainly could say, &#8216;I don&#8217;t have a non-disclosure agreement.&#8217; Yes?&#8221; Kimmel asked.<br />
&#8220;You&#8217;re so smart, Jimmy,&#8221; Daniels answered.</p>
<p>Later in the interview, Kimmel asked, &#8220;Have you ever made love to someone whose name rhymes with Lonald Lump?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call you whatever you want me to call you, baby,&#8221; Daniels responded.</p>

PHOTO | COURTESY" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;" /><p>The High Court has revoked the deportation of Nasa activist Miguna Miguna to Canada last week.</p>
<p>Justice Luka Kimaru on Thursday dismissed Miguna&#8217;s deportation as null and void and that it had no merit in law.</p>
<p>Justice Kimaru further directed the Immigration Department to deposit Miguna&#8217;s revoked passport to the registrar of court within seven days.</p>
<p>In his ruling, the Judge reasoned that Miguna was deported at a time Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and Director of Criminal Investigation George Kinoti were in contempt of court orders.</p>

<p>The team&#8217;s mandate will be to prevent grabbing and repossess county land that has ended up into private ownership.</p>
<p>Governor Sonko said the war on land grabbing will continue until all reported cases are resolved.</p>
<p>This comes days after the governor repossessed a grabbed public land that was housing Eden Home Rehabilitation Centre in Parklands.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, county officials moved in Pumwani area where a prominent businessman is said to have intended to grab part of the land on which Pumwani Maternity Hospital stands.</p>
<p>The tycoon reportedly sent in police officers to arrest a county officer, Barnabas Asembo, who was staying in a house on the piece of land in question.</p>
<p>“Today at dawn, a lab technician working at Pumwani Maternity Hospital was harassed by some individuals in presence of police officers who were forcing him to vacate from a county house he has been living in.</p>
<p>“I am perturbed by the way some police officers are conducting investigation in regard to land grabbing syndicates,” said Sonko Thursday.</p>
<p>Mr Asembo was arrested on Monday at his home and booked at Pangani police station.</p>
<p><strong>WANTED TERRORIST</strong></p>
<p>“I was arrested like a wanted terrorist. My rights were infringed. If Governor Sonko had not intervened, this piece of land would have been grabbed long time ago,” said Asembo.</p>
<p>But Pumwani DCI Zachary Mbaya said they are interrogating the matter and once they have concluded the investigation the culprits will face full wrath of the law.</p>
<p>“We are still on the matter. The culprits involved will automatically be prosecuted,” he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, City Hall has said it will partner with Eden House Foundation to establish a rehabilitation centre in the Ngara area to help individuals struggling with alcohol abuse, substance abuse and drug addiction.</p>
<p>Ms Primrose Mbuvi, the governor’s wife, gave the foundation a sh300, 000 cheque to help them rent a new premise in Ngara.</p>
<p>“I have given sh300, 000 to the directors of Eden House to look for an alternative place to hire to continue with their great work and also we are still looking on their proposal so that we can partner with them,” Ms Mbuvi said.</p>

<p>The second-largest expenditure item was Foreign Affairs, which cost Sh98.9 million.</p>
<p><strong>STATE HOUSE LUNCH</strong></p>
<p>After the ceremony at Safaricom Stadium in Kasarani, Nairobi, the guests headed to State House for lunch that the committee says cost Sh46 million.</p>
<p>The committee reported that media and communications for the event cost Sh45.9 million and entertainment Sh15 million.</p>
<p>Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho said on the eve of the ceremony that the budget for the event was Sh384 million, which would also cover the Jamhuri Day fete two weeks later.</p>
<p>This suggests that the committee spent less than what had been provided for.</p>
<p>The report was submitted to Parliament as per the Assumption of Office of the President Act but it was not immediately clear which committee of the National Assembly would scrutinise it.</p>
<p>Much earlier, Mr Joseph Kinyua, President Kenyatta’s Chief of Staff and Head of Public Service, had said the inauguration would cost Sh300 million.</p>
<p><strong>ATTENDANCE</strong></p>
<p>The report states that 180,000 people attended the ceremony, most of whom could not fit in the stadium.</p>
<p>They followed the event on screens mounted outside the stadium.</p>
<p>The committee asked MPs to change the law to enable the President retain full powers if the Supreme Court annuls a re-election, as happened last year.</p>
<p>It recommends that “temporary incumbency” be lifted in such circumstances until the day of the fresh election.</p>
<p>This would enable the President to appoint Cabinet and Principal secretaries, reshuffle the Cabinet, appoint commissioners, ambassadors and judges of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p><strong>SUPREME COURT</strong></p>
<p>Interestingly, the Supreme Court judges would preside over disputes arising from the repeat election, raising concerns that the Constitution is being amended indirectly.</p>
<p>It would give a President whose re-election has been nullified the power to appoint Supreme Court judges yet the same court would preside over disputes about his election.</p>

<p>In the picture, another man is seen holding a stick over the head of the woman who wore a distressed facial expression.</p>
<p>Some believe that Zuma alluded to the image in his resignation speech on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>“I have also been disturbed by the instances of violence that have occurred because of the different views among members of our organization outside our headquarters, Luthuli House. No life should be lost in my name and also the ANC should never be divided in my name,” said Zuma.</p>
<p>“I have therefore come to the decision to resign as President of the Republic with immediate effect.”</p>

<p>South African press reported that the incident took place on Monday in a series of protests and counter-protests outside ANC headquarters Luthuli House.</p>
<p>The unidentified woman was assaulted by an ANC member identified as Johannesburg branch secretary named Thabiso Setona.</p>
<p>Setona was quickly suspended with immediate effect, reports ann7.com.</p>

<h2 class="p2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong style="font-size: 24px;">CONSOLE MATTIACCI LAW FILES CLASS CLAIM AGAINST AT&amp;T FOR AGE DISCRIMINATION</strong></span></h2>
<p class="p1">Any AT&amp;T employee who signed an invalid release <strong>still may have the right to bring a federal age discrimination claim and keep the severance they were paid</strong>.&nbsp; Under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), in order for a worker to release their ADEA claims, information must be presented by the company in a group layoff that sets forth the ages and job titles of people laid off and not laid off.&nbsp; This is required by the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act &ndash; it makes sense because this data helps an employee and their lawyer see if there was age discrimination in the terminations.&nbsp; Any release that does not set forth the required information is invalid.</p>
<p><strong>On <span style="text-decoration: underline;">January 11, 2016</span>, Console Mattiacci Law won an AGE discrimination VERDICT against AT&amp;T in federal court. For details, see below:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Console Mattiacci Law won a unanimous jury verdict in federal court on behalf of former employee, Jack Gerundo, in an age discrimination case against AT&amp;T.&nbsp;Mr. Gerundo, age 66 at the time, alleged that he was terminated by AT&amp;T in connection with a &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; event that occurred in March of 2013, which resulted in many older employees losing their jobs. &nbsp;The jury found that Mr. Gerundo&rsquo;s age was the determinative factor in AT&amp;T&rsquo;s decision to &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; him, whichresulted in the loss of his job, and awarded him $370,000 in damages. <a href="our-firm/attorneys/laura-carlin-mattiacci/">Laura C. Mattiacci</a>&nbsp;the lead trial attorney for Mr. Gerdundo, said that it took a tremendous amount of time and work to uncover the details of the discriminatory decision-making process at AT&amp;T and beleives the final judgment in the case should be in excess of $1 million after the attorney's fees and costs incurred are accessed. &nbsp;Read more about the case&nbsp;<a href="blog/worker-wins-age-discrimination-case-against-att/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="p2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong style="font-size: 24px;">CONSOLE MATTIACCI LAW WINS JURY VERDICT OF MORE THAN $1.5 MILLION ON BEHALF OF FORMER PHILLIES PITCHER MITCH WILLIAMS AGAINST MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL NETWORK</strong></span></h2>
<p style="font-family: Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">On <span style="text-decoration: underline;">June 20, 2017</span>, after an 11 day jury trial in Camden, a jury found in favor of former Phillie, Mitch Williams, in his breach of contract claim against MLB Network. The amount of the award is $1,565,333. The jury rejected MLB Network's allegations that Mr. Williams violated the "morals clause" in his contract in regards to events that occurred at a youth baseball game in 2014 where he was the manager.<br /><br />Laura Carlin Mattiacci, of Console Mattiacci Law and lead trial counsel for Mitch Williams, stated "This verdict completely vindicates Mitch Williams, who was viciously defamed by anonymous sources on the internet and then had MLB Network breach its contract with him. Justice was served today." Ms. Mattiacci was also assisted by Rahul Munshi at trial.</p>
<h2 class="p2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong style="font-size: 24px;">CONSOLE MATTIACCI LAW WINS $51.56 MILLION AGE DISCRIMINATION VERDICT AGAINST LOCKHEED MARTIN</strong></span></h2>
<p style="font-family: Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">In the evening hours on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">January 26, 2017</span>, after a four day trial, a federal jury in Camden, New Jersey rendered an age discrimination verdict in favor of Robert Braden and against Lockheed Martin in the amount of $51,560,000.&nbsp; The verdict included a punitive damages award pursuant to the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination in the amount of $50,000,000.&nbsp; Plaintiff's trial counsel were <a href="our-firm/attorneys/rahul-munshi/">Rahul Munshi</a> and Emily R. Derstine Friesen of Console Mattiacci Law, LLC.&nbsp; The verdict is one of the largest ever obtained by an individual plaintiff in an age discrimination case.&nbsp; At the time of his layoff, Mr. Braden was 66 years old, and had worked at Lockheed Martin for approximately 29 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The case involved a reduction in force which Mr. Braden claimed was an effort by Lockheed Martin to target older workers in a scheme to lay them off and replace them with younger workers.&nbsp; The jury of eight unanimously agreed, awarding Mr. Braden all of the economic loss he sought ($520,000), concluding that the action was willful (which adds liquidated damages of $520,000, pursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act), and further awarding Mr. Braden pain and suffering damages of $520,000.&nbsp; The jury later concluded that Lockheed Martin was subject to punitive damages in the amount of $50,000,000.&nbsp; Stephen G. Console, a founding partner of Console Mattiacci Law, LLC, commented about the verdict:&nbsp; &ldquo;The jury sent a loud and clear message to corporate America: no company is too big to follow the civil rights laws of this amazing country of ours.&nbsp; This is a verdict that should make every employee in this country proud and happy.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</h2>
<h2 style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><strong style="font-size: 2em;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONSOLE MATTIACCI LAW WINS FEDERAL COURT JURY VERDICT AGAINST GOLDEN NUGGET</span></strong></h2>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Console Mattiacci Law, LLC won a jury verdict in federal court on behalf of former employee, Mike Jackson, in a disability discrimination and retaliation case against the casino, Golden Nugget of Atlantic City. Mr. Jackson was represented by lead trial counsel, <a href="our-firm/attorneys/laura-carlin-mattiacci/">Laura C. Mattiacci</a> and was assisted by Lane J. Schiff, both of Console Mattiacci Law, LLC. The verdict was rendered on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">December 13, 2016</span>, after a six day trial in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey before the Honorable Joseph H. Rodriguez. The jury found that Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s disability was a determinative factor in Golden Nugget&rsquo;s decision not to hire him. They also found that his request for an accommodation and/or alleged complaint regarding the failure to accommodate him was a determinative factor in Golden Nugget&rsquo;s decision not to hire him. The jury was asked only to assess &ldquo;compensatory damages&rdquo; (compensation for pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, or loss of enjoyment of life) as a result of the failure to hire and returned a unanimous verdict of $340,000. Mr. Jackson, who made approximately $48,000 a year, also has back-pay losses of approximately $170,000 as well as front-pay losses, the award of which will be determined by the Judge. A petition for reimbursement of attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs will also be submitted, which Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s counsel believes should bring the final award to approximately $1 million.&nbsp;Read more about the case by clicking <a href="blog/console-law-wins-federal-court-jury-verdict-against-golden-nugget-casino-in-disability-discrimination-case/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="p2"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">CONSOLE MATTIACCI LAW'S FEDERAL COURT JURY VERDICT AGAINST AT&amp;T AFFIRMED ON APPEAL</span></span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On December 20, 2016</span>, Judge Schmehl of the United States District Court for the Eastern DIstrict of Pennsylvania denied the appeal of AT&amp;T to overturn the verdict rendered last January. &nbsp;Console Mattiacci Law, LLC had won a unanimous jury verdict in federal court on behalf of former employee, Jack Gerundo, in an age discrimination case against AT&amp;T.&nbsp;Mr. Gerundo, age 66 at the time, alleged that he was terminated by AT&amp;T in connection with a &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; event that occurred in March of 2013, which resulted in many older employees losing their jobs. &nbsp;The jury found that Mr. Gerundo&rsquo;s age was the determinative factor in AT&amp;T&rsquo;s decision to &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; him, which resulted in the loss of his job, and awarded him $370,000 in damages.&nbsp; <a href="our-firm/attorneys/laura-carlin-mattiacci/">Laura C. Mattiacci</a>, the lead trial attorney for Mr. Gerundo, said that it took a tremendous amount of time and work to uncover the details of the discriminatory decision-making process at AT&amp;T and believes the final judgment in the case should exceed $900,000 after the attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs incurred are accessed. &nbsp;Read more about the case by clicking&nbsp;<a href="blog/worker-wins-age-discrimination-case-against-att/">here</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In denying AT&amp;T's appeal, the Judge recognized the work done during trial to establish bias by the defendant and to discredit the decision-maker. The Court's opinion read in part: "Roth was impeached several times by plaintiff&rsquo;s counsel, including a particularly effective video impeachment concerning the reason why Roth would simply not keep plaintiff on the Fiserv account since he was doing a good job... Having witnessed Roth&rsquo;s demeanor on the stand, the jury apparently did not credit Roth&rsquo;s trial testimony that she was not the relevant decision maker... When viewed cumulatively, ample evidence existed in the record from which the jury could either "disbelieve the defendants' articulated legitimate reasons or believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the employer's action."&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 24px; text-decoration: underline;">THIRD CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS RULES IN FAVOR OF Console Mattiacci Law, LLC, REVERSING THE TRIAL COURT'S DISMISSAL OF A RACE DISCRIMINATION CLAIM AND SENDING THE CASE TO A JURY TRIAL</span></h2>
<p>The Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Console Mattiacci Law, LLC' clients, two African-American business owners who operated an Avis location. The Court reversed the dismissal of a race discrimination case, in an opinion authored by Judge Restrepo. &nbsp;The Court ruled that there were genuine issues of material fact in dispute concerning Avis' stated reason for terminating the contract of the African-American owners represented by Console Mattiacci Law, LLC. As a result, the dismissal was reversed and the race discrimination case is heading back to the trial court for a jury trial. The appeal was argued by CLO Attorney, Rahul Munshi.<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp; You can read the full opinion&nbsp;</span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="assets/uploads/docs/McClain.Opinion.pdf">here</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">. &nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>Protecting the Rights of Employees in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York</h3>
<p>Federal, state and local laws protect employees against various forms of discrimination based on a variety of different factors, including gender, race, national origin, age, religion, sexual orientation, whether or not the person has a real or perceived disability and if the employee is pregnant.</p>
<p>Discrimination can include harassment. If a worker has been sexually harassed at work from unwelcome advances or crude comments, she or he has been discriminated against due to her or his gender.</p>
<p>At Console Mattiacci Law, LLC, our lawyers fight to make sure workers who have been unlawfully discriminated or retaliated against recover for the damage done by their employer, including lost back pay, lost future pay, emotional distress damages, punitive damages and attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs.</p>
<p>Employees who are denied overtime in violation of federal and state law have a right to recover for the money they would have been paid, as well as liquidated damages and attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs.</p>
<p>If you make a complaint of discrimination, your employer may not retaliate against under the law. This means the employer cannot terminate you or make your working conditions less favorable without violating the law. For decades, Console Mattiacci Law, LLC has held those employers who retaliate against employees accountable and have recovered substantial sums for wrongfully treated employees.</p>
<p>Console Mattiacci Law, LLC represents clients in <a href="https://www.consolelaw.com/new-jersey/" target="_blank">New Jersey</a>, <a href="https://www.consolelaw.com/contact-us/pennsylvania/" target="_blank">Pennsylvania</a>, and surrounding areas, throughout the United States.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Protecting Whistleblowers in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>If a company engages in conduct that is illegal or against the policy of the state, employees are encouraged to report that conduct to an attorney. The attorneys at Console Mattiacci Law, LLC will thoroughly explain the laws that protect you and the substantial recovery you may be entitled to for reporting the conduct.</p>
<p>A common area of whistleblower law involves fraud upon the government. This can include Medicare or Medicaid fraud, illegal kickbacks, overpricing of government contracts, or off-label marketing of pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>However, in order to be a whistleblower, the fraud does not necessarily need to be against the government. It could simply be other types of illegal conduct or actions in violation of the public policy of the state.</p>
<p>There are substantial recoveries available to whistleblowers who report inappropriate conduct. If you are aware of such conduct, contact the attorneys at Console Mattiacci Law, LLC for a full and thorough consultation. The sooner you consult with an attorney, the better because in some cases the deadline to file is only 180 days from your first awareness of the improper conduct.</p>
<p>Moreover, for some federal whistleblower claims, you must be the &ldquo;first to file&rdquo; &ndash; meaning you need to be the first person to have reported this conduct to the government in order to be entitled to the whistleblower reward. The attorneys at Console Mattiacci Law, LLC are experienced in handling these matters. In 2013, Console Mattiacci Law, LLC won the largest whistleblower verdict in the state of Pennsylvania with a unanimous jury verdict. Contact them today to see if you have a case.</p>

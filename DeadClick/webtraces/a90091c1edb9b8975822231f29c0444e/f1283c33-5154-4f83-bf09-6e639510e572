				<div class="entry-content">
			<p id="top" />         Autistic people have rights just the way everyone has rights to be a leader of their life; Autistic people are thinking the way they want to think and are also human beings too with our own mind. Autistic people have feelings often feeling for others and have feelings that often feel pain by many other people who do not understand us. Autistic people grow up at different paces while others may just grow at the same pace as their physical age. Because many Autistic people grow at different paces, we are often thought of as less than human, deviant from the norm, and due to our impairments many in society look down upon us thinking we do not have a mind of our own nor are we able to make logical decisions about the life we want.</p>
<p>         Though, Autistic people are vulnerable, and depending on the impairments, depend on how vulnerable the individual will be.  It does not matter if the person is less impaired, they can be more vulnerable. Just because Autistic people are vulnerable does not mean we are not our own person. May be so many do think that way because Autistic people feel so many emotions at once, that at times we either do not know how to use our emotions scaling back inward or use our emotions too much being considered to be over-emotional, rageful, and illogical. Whichever way Autistic people are, we are misunderstood by society as a whole, thus society is misguided in the way everyone should think of Autistic culture and human society in general.</p>
<p>       From all of this misunderstandings and misguided ideas from years of a perception that someone with cognitive and sensory impairments is not capable, not competent, some in society are finally learning today. The tragedy of this kind of thinking has created this between Autistic people and the rest of society.  There are a lot of people who need to take responsibility for these actions.</p>
<p>         Many people before Autism Speaks have contributed to this between Autistic people and the rest of society. Unfortunately, the mainstream mass media has contributed to this as well by conforming to the ideas of this subjective interpretation. Many people are suffering from a society that lacks understanding. This war against Autistic people is really a war against humanity and human nature. The battle to fight for either correcting the genome from disability to embracing the genome and realizing cognitive disabilities like the way Autistic culture is, is something that needs to be accepted just as many other neurodivergences need to be accepted too.</p>
<p>How far do we go to changing the human genome? Is it our right to change the genome that mutates and changes randomly over time? Who gets to say which parts of the genome are bad or not? And, is the human genome really a bad thing as many medical researchers are trying to correct it to make a perfected flawless human being? Is eugenics or genetic counseling really needed?</p>
<p>       My feelings as a person who is Neurodivergent from outside the norms of society and as an Autistic person leads me to believe that I often feel like pushing to be who I am while getting pull back from society to make me the same as how others are.  The fine line between autonomy and being who we are versus depending on others to conform to the standards of society is enormously thick, yet we need to pull one way and push another to be included in the community. Autism Speaks as an organization has been through a rough war because many people feel their misguided thinking for almost 13 years has been too hurtful to many who feel they want to embrace who they are regardless. This makes me feel that everyone needs to re-think what we have done in the past.</p>
<p>      Our society created the mindset of the perfect mind and body back when Francis Galton created the word ‘eugenics’ and the world decided that between Darwin’s evolutionary theory and his cousin, Galton and his creation of the word ‘eugenics’, that everyone became instantly obsessed with the human genome. To perfect the body and mind is to deny disability and separate from the imperfect human body to create a monster master race of the human genome that everyone will strive to be. This monster master race that everyone has been striving for since the late 19th Century, created the thinking that Hitler wanted to first exterminate people with varying degrees of impairments to eventually exterminating certain races, religions, and other peoples in the Holocaust who he thought society could do away with. I am sorry to say, but the world created the way Hitler would eventually think about how the human genome, race, and religion whether we like it or not. We couldn&#8217;t control how some people would interpret this thinking even today. However, this is not the only thing we need to take responsibility for, we also need to take responsibility for many other things throughout history both in our private lives and in the public.</p>
<p>     Everyone seems to not understand that trying to perfect a human genome is trying to perfect something that is constantly mutating, constantly changing, and constantly moving around in our bodies just like the universe is constantly moving. We are human beings so I understand why many people are obsessed with perfecting (and perfected) bodies and minds. However, perfecting a body and mind, is a very fine line between what we think is autonomy and what we think we need to depend on others for help. As we are Human beings who live in this world, we are connected to each other regardless of the way we identify through race, religion, sexuality, gender, or disability cultures. The way we represent ourselves is independent of being human because being human really means that we need to support one another regardless since we all go through the same trials, tribulations, and rewards in life.</p>
<p>    Supporting decisions and the way we as individuals experience life is important. The person centered approach most are beginning to learn now, is something that is a part of human nature since the beginning of time. Yet, we have in the past, and in some ways still do, only respect the decisions some people made, while others we felt could not make decisions at all and could not think on their own. We need to give everyone the tools to decide and think about what they want in their life on their own. This thinking presumed (and in some ways continues to presume) many people that their decisions are illogical and not right. Making decisions for our life depends on what kinds of decisions we are making. Some decisions we can decide on our own, but many other decisions we need support from people who can help us choose in making the best decision our life. In the end, the final decision is ours.</p>
<p>    Whenever anyone makes a decision, it not only affects us, but it also affects everyone close to us in that decision, and in some ways can affect the rest of society as well.  For example, when any one decides that they want to change the way their child is, they are making a conscious decision that will affect the way their child will feel about themselves and toward others as well. These decisions we make affect us individually in many different ways. If a child rebels against their parent’s decision to change who they are, then the child and parents must take responsibility for their actions. Deciding on changing the way a person is, also changes the way everyone feels about themselves. It is important to attribute every decision we make to the way we think about others and ourselves in our life. When we think about who we are as a person, we think about where we came from, and the people in our life that affect what we think. Sometimes what we think can hurt who we are and/or other people.</p>
<p>    Autism Speaks may not have been thinking everything through in the past how they are helping Autistic people in society may not be actually helping Autistics in society, but they are learning over time slowly.  Every organization has their own agenda to what they think they are doing is right. Yet, everyone and every organization, through medical charity or self-advocacy, cannot know exactly how everyone feels because we all have our thought process and experiences that are different than others.</p>
<p>    When thinking about supported decision-making, everyone thinks about the way they want to live their life. For example, an individual may choose a different way of living than many other people do on an actual daily basis, but that does not mean that individual is not living a quality life. A quality life is subjective to what an individual actually feels they want in their life. No one can suggest a better quality of life or social skills to make others conform to a society that is not universally designed for everyone.  We need to remember who the person is as an individual and how individuality really is what everyone wants as a single mind of their own.</p>
<p>   This leads to too much frustration because of a social construction of conformity the mainstream media has used every day. Some people may be more frustrated with who they are than other people because their experiences with how society treated them or how individuals who treated them in the past made them feel particularly unjustified and unaccepted living their life.  This responsibility is what everyone needs to fully grasp and think about how to create a unified world with justice.</p>
<p>    Everyone has their own way of living while having their pride and joy that makes them feel good about who they are. Everyone does what is right for them, but no one has a right to tell a person that the way they are living is not quality of life. Many times some impairments create situations that make a person feel they cannot function enough and in fact need accessibility and universal design to help them get by or even thrive in society.  So, why cannot we create universal design in everything we do in society so that everyone feels that they can live their life the way they know best?  Our society has always conformed to the idea that its citizens are vulnerable and need to be corrected to fit in, not in their natural way of living.</p>
<p>   The world is a tough place to live in.  Autistic people can be vulnerable, everyone is different to the person next to them, and simultaneously we can all be vulnerable to what others are thinking. However, it does not mean as individuals that vulnerability is a weakness.  Everyone is an individual who can think on their own. Human culture is defined; all of us think whoever is standing out in that moment yelling their voice the loudest, is the leader.  This is not true, we are all leaders of our own life.</p>
<p>   In order to think through how to create a less vulnerable society, we can help by providing to strive for universally designing a world that everyone can live in with dignity, respect, getting their voices heard, and able to function with everyone around them no matter what. Everyone can lead their own life whatever way they want to live. We need to do better and we need to ease the pains of so many people, including Autistic and non-autistic alike.  </p>

			<p id="top" />Labels,</p>
<p>by theamazinj</p>
<p>Labels are important,<br />
they can be very powerful,<br />
when one is called stupid<br />
to when one is called crazy.<br />
Labels are important,<br />
they tell the kinds of things a person is.<br />
Labels are powerful<br />
when used<br />
like when we are called Brilliant, Honest, or a Liar.<br />
Labels can hurt or be very respectful<br />
especially when using the words,<br />
Racist, Ableist, Abuser, or even Loving.<br />
Words can hurt, but they can also heal.<br />
I love you. I hate you. I despise you. I am in awe of you.<br />
Labels are NOT just for cans, they are for everything and everyone.<br />
It&#8217;s why TAXONOMY exists, it&#8217;s why we always use them.<br />
Labels are important.<br />
I love you,<br />
I hate you,<br />
I filter you.<br />
I am so in love.<br />
I am so in anger.<br />
I have anxiety for you.<br />
Labels are important.<br />
Labels are important.<br />
Labels are important.<br />
Labels help and can also hurt.<br />
They hurt when we use the R word,<br />
they hurt when we use the N word,<br />
however, we spin a word around<br />
and make it a different word with a different meaning<br />
so easily.<br />
Like for the R word, Rich,<br />
and the N word, Neighborly.<br />
When we think of words,<br />
we need to think of the positive words<br />
and the positive meanings<br />
and when we want to criticize,<br />
instead of saying,<br />
Ableist or Racist or Misgyonist or Sexist or Heterosexist or even pervert,<br />
we need to treat people with respect and positive their whole lives,<br />
once we label a negative word to a person<br />
it sticks with that person for life.<br />
Life&#8217;s journey is saturated with labels,<br />
it&#8217;s saturated with bigotry,<br />
it&#8217;s saturated with misunderstandings and miscommunications,<br />
So, does labels go on cans and people?<br />
Of course they do, they do every day.<br />
So, it&#8217;s labels important?<br />
Yes, of course they are.<br />
Labels were created because of TAXONOMY,<br />
because of categorizing,<br />
but we can label things giving people something to live up to,<br />
or we can label things giving people a dark windy tunnel to run through<br />
trying to find the light.<br />
sometimes we have to realize,<br />
Being disabled is a part of life and is not a bad word,<br />
we have to realize being Autistic is a part of life too,<br />
we have to remember being Neurodivergent is a part of life as well,<br />
and that society&#8217;s so called &#8216;normal&#8217; is derogatory<br />
even when called &#8216;neurotypical&#8217; now and even<br />
the way everyone embraces that social construction of &#8216;normal&#8217; or &#8216;neurotypical&#8217;.<br />
TAXONOMY is important, and labels are so powerful,<br />
Just think about the labels<br />
and you can think about your life.<br />
Labels that are given to and accepted by individual citizens<br />
do in fact define a person,<br />
so think about when you call a person crazy, stupid, insane, ugly, overemotional, or even irrational,<br />
how much pain you may be causing someone,<br />
and may be you may want to use more positive words about anyone,<br />
like intelligent, creative, loving, caring, and even beautiful.<br />
Words matter, labels matter, labels mean everything.<br />
The social construction of &#8216;normal&#8217; is important, but not very logical.<br />
Just remember being disabled or being neurodivergent is a thing<br />
everyone experiences.</p>

			<p id="top" />From Death to Life, </p>
<p>by theamazinJ</p>
<p>I died.<br />
I live.<br />
I went to heaven.<br />
I went home.<br />
I came back.<br />
I went home.<br />
I left the hill.<br />
I walked the plank.<br />
I swam in the ocean.<br />
I climbed the highest cliff.<br />
I walked across on the bridge to the next cliff.<br />
I flew with my wings.<br />
I flew to the ground.<br />
I dropped my wings.<br />
I started walking.<br />
I walked over the bounty.<br />
I crawled onto the ground.<br />
I sprawled my body spreading myself on the grass.<br />
I sent over my gold.<br />
I received my award.<br />
I journeyed through the heavens.<br />
I spent my ferocious volume expending my knowledge.<br />
I guru&#8217;d my life.<br />
I leapt through thou.<br />
Thou created me.<br />
I created thou.<br />
I am Thou.<br />
I am heaven.<br />
I am hell.<br />
I am darkness.<br />
I am light.<br />
I am.<br />
Up, down, up, down.<br />
Lifting me.<br />
You lift yourself.<br />
I am lift me.<br />
I expend the journey of death<br />
to live life into my head,<br />
into my brain, into my mind,<br />
into my heart bleeding before you.<br />
I spill myself to you.<br />
My richness into the light,<br />
my goals of the spot.<br />
My spot going good,<br />
depleting the bad.<br />
Spilling my guts.<br />
OMG OMG OMG,<br />
I am dead, no, I AM ALIVE.<br />
My liveliness is a journey.<br />
the pill is pain,<br />
the passing to be something different is hard.<br />
the passing to be me is easy.<br />
the passing to be disabled,<br />
the passing to be non-disabled,<br />
the passing to be neurotypical,<br />
the passing to be the original neurodivergent self I am,<br />
passing into the slides of pane healing the pain.<br />
Life constitutes life.<br />
Death hardens death.<br />
Death is a social construction.<br />
Life is continuous.<br />
Continuous life while crossing the curtain,<br />
while crossing over to the other side.<br />
The other side that is unknown,<br />
that is scary, and that is life.<br />
Life is scary, but we need to jump at it.<br />
Life is scary, but we need to focus on what we want,<br />
not what others want, but really what we want individually.<br />
The tyrant or the martyr or just the person that we are.<br />
I love you. I love you so much. I love you with all my might.<br />
My mighty love is great, it is extensive.<br />
extensive to be smart, to show our intelligence, to brighten up with our creative nature.<br />
Making artistic expression, making creative continuity, filming our life&#8217;s journey<br />
into the separate waves of the world.<br />
I love you, can you love the world you&#8217;re in?<br />
I love you, can you turn your hate into love?<br />
I love you, can you turn your naive, ignorant, and lies into truth?<br />
I Love YOU, so I want to see you in my heart, in my dreams, and in my reality,<br />
because, I love you, I love all of you, and I love every piece of everyone.<br />
Spend time in your heart to love<br />
when life can go from low to high in a blink of an eye,<br />
essentially cause of how much you show love<br />
and how much you gain from love.<br />
Spread love to spread life until we cross over into the depths of more life.</p>

			<p id="top" />Blank blah blah blah no words to express,</p>
<p>by theamazinJ</p>
<p>It takes effort,<br />
It takes comfort,<br />
It takes me,<br />
It takes determination,<br />
It takes a willingness to be honest,<br />
It takes the ability to do,<br />
so why lie or be lied to,<br />
when there is the truth,<br />
when there is the honesty of the truth,<br />
when everywhere we go the truth is behind us,<br />
the truth sets us free,<br />
even when we have done things to hurt,<br />
even when we have done things irresponsibly,<br />
even when we have triggered many people,<br />
even from our own chronic post traumatic stress throughout life,<br />
even with the hurt and pain that we have felt<br />
it doesn&#8217;t mean others have to feel that pain too,<br />
it does not mean everyone needs to hear it,<br />
it just means we have to let it go,<br />
It just means we can&#8217;t hold on to something just because,<br />
It doesn&#8217;t mean that we allow anxiety to take it over<br />
and control it and exasperate the events or what was heard or done that was painful,<br />
It just means that we let it go,<br />
Let it go and move forward,<br />
understand, determine, listen, guide,<br />
sure, many took advantage of who I am,<br />
sure, many misunderstood and misunderstand the person I am,<br />
sure, sure, sure,<br />
it just does not mean everything needs to be about what happened or what was said or what was done,<br />
it&#8217;s about believing, feeling, and shutting it out of the mind,<br />
putting it in the back of the mind<br />
to recall once we are lying on our old bed with gray and smiles all around<br />
ready for a laugh, ready to wipe away the tears, and ready to move forward,<br />
for now, it&#8217;s time to move forward on the journey to that moment,<br />
it&#8217;s time to live the life it was meant to be,<br />
it&#8217;s time to think everything about what I want and not so much what everyone else wants or just thinking about everyone,<br />
it&#8217;s my life, it&#8217;s my art, it&#8217;s my films, it&#8217;s my poetry, it&#8217;s my work as a scholar I am meant to do to make differences,<br />
It&#8217; time to live, it&#8217;s time to focus on me, it&#8217;s time to de-focus on those past events, those past things I tried, and be in the present,<br />
I am me, so who are you.<br />
I want me, so what do you want.<br />
I crave my talents. So, what are you going to do about it.<br />
I always listen to my own mind. So, what do you think about that.<br />
I study, I read, I paint, I film, I do many things within my studies. So, how do you like them apples?<br />
I mark my journey to the end to the beginning when I am ready. So, what?<br />
I scope the map of my journey and everything I want to do and get done before it&#8217;s too late. Hah, are you ready for me? are you ready for what I can do?<br />
I will have a positive life that I want to have. A-HA, why are you laughing?<br />
I know what I am capable of and I know when and how I need support. Think about that.<br />
So, let&#8217;s go and do this thing we call life, and live.<br />
Because in the end, it&#8217;s all about living while having ups and downs, while maneuvering through obstacles, and working on what I want,<br />
looking forward to the beginning when I am ready, and the journey to the beginning when I am old and gray.<br />
Let&#8217;s do this! let&#8217;s live! let&#8217;s give it our all! And, once and for all, let&#8217;s just be the best we can be!<br />
Take care and see you around.</p>

			<p id="top" />A Different Normal, A Normal different me, Different Kinds of Relationships,</p>
<p>Thinking of me, think of you,</p>
<p>by theamazinJ</p>
<p>Thinking of you, me,<br />
Thinking of what &#8216;special needs&#8217; that really aren&#8217;t special because they are just our needs,<br />
thinking like you think I can do things that are very hard for me,<br />
and thinking you think I can&#8217;t do things that are easy for me,<br />
I have a lot of energy, but I am disabled.<br />
I am able, yes, but I am also disabled.<br />
Disability is part of the human experience and everyone needs to embrace their life and love everyone every day regardless<br />
because at any point, life can be over, or we can become disabled or more disabled even&#8230;<br />
I can become more disabled any day like you can become disabled at any time.<br />
and you will still see and think I can do things all the time even though I am disabled.<br />
Normal is different, normal is fake, normal is unreal,<br />
I am disabled, and pushed to the brink of my energy, my time, and my limits,<br />
even when my spoons are low or my lifely body portrays you to think of what you think,<br />
You tell me to use my spoons wisely, so as not to burnout,<br />
you tell me to work on things of what you want me to work on,<br />
when I am who I am, even with what I can do and can&#8217;t do all the time,<br />
even with being able to do anything at any time I am able to do it,<br />
I can&#8217;t do anything everything everyday, but I can do anything at my time.<br />
I noticed I do things when my feeling to do the thing<br />
I want to do is when I have the spoons to do it<br />
and decide to focus on that thing I want to perfect or just want to do or just need something to do to feel good,<br />
Disability is a thing, it exists, and we have to accept<br />
the things we do, things we don&#8217;t do, and things we have the spoons for to do the thing we are doing,<br />
I am different, yes, and most importantly, I am disabled and able,<br />
I able to do things on my time, when I am ready, and when I have ambition, and when I have determination to do it,<br />
My normal is different from you, different to you, and very potent to my life,<br />
I can do, I do need support, but I don&#8217;t need you to tell me or what you think I can and can&#8217;t do,</p>
<p>What is support,</p>
<p>by theamazinJ</p>
<p>Support is different because support is helping someone like me achieve self-determination of what I want to do, of what I need to do, when I am ready to do it,<br />
Support is giving me the time to live on my own in my own living area with my own things and seeing you when we have time for each other,<br />
Support is giving me the opportunity to do what I want and what I choose for myself and supporting me while doing it,<br />
even when I am writing something on my own, even when I am doing art, even when I am creating film, even when I am reading on my own, or even when I just need space,<br />
Support is giving not what you think, it is not giving me love when you think you want to give it, but reading me well enough to know when I want it,<br />
Support is giving you love when I feel you want it,<br />
Support is not telling me rather just giving me the opportunity to talk about certain things that are hard for me to talk about,<br />
Support is not telling me, and thinking I just don&#8217;t know and am told, and support is being included in conversations about me,<br />
Support is great when I am supported and not told, supported and loved, supported and can talk to you about things that are hard for me to make it easier,<br />
support is when my anxiety is eased because I don&#8217;t feel pressured, I don&#8217;t feel told, and I am feeling in control,<br />
I love my support regardless who you are,<br />
I need support in certain areas just the way anyone else needs support in those areas, so just give me a chance to tell you what support I need and when I need it,<br />
and I will listen and know when and who can support at the time,<br />
so please understand what support really is.</p>
<p>Support when I need you,</p>
<p>by theamazinJ</p>
<p>Being told is not a good feeling, being told makes me feel out of control, being told I can&#8217;t connect with everyone is limiting me, being told is being out of control,<br />
I need your support and finally understanding,<br />
I need your support so that I don&#8217;t walk away in pain when I feel you don&#8217;t understand and am low on spoonful energy, and need time to reconvene myself to you, or even when I feel hurt,<br />
even when you don&#8217;t understand why I am walking away even for a day or even sometimes longer than that,<br />
It does not mean I don&#8217;t love you, and it does not mean I don&#8217;t care, it just means I need time because of the way you approach me or the way you understand things about me makes me cringe,<br />
I need your support so that you know the love we give to each other when we all need love,<br />
I need your support.<br />
I know I left you at times, some longer than others, but I need your support, not your telling me, and not your ridiculing me, with easing on sarcasm, and definitely not your abrading me as if I feel like a nothing,<br />
I am a person too even though I am disabled, even with being autistic, or even with my anxiety, or even with my sensory system, or even with my way of understanding the world,<br />
or even with my way of feeling for you,<br />
because I love you, I love all of you,<br />
I love the way everyone loves me.<br />
I am grateful for the love for me.<br />
Support is when my life is not empty, and I have someone to go to talk with about something may be hard to handle at the moment<br />
ultimately giving me the power to make my decision as the decision maker in my life.<br />
I have services that give me my support workers, that give me my broker, that give me an agency too, that give me someone looking over my money I get for my services,<br />
but that does not mean I need to be told, I just have a team of whoever wants to support me any time I need it and give me the time.<br />
I love you, I love everyone because I am loved by all, loved by everyone.<br />
I left you for a reason that left me needing my space away to have enough spoons to deal with you and think about ways you can better support me,<br />
I needed this because you seemed to not understand, you seemed to think you knew everything even without listening to my thoughts, my opinions, my ideas, my creativeness,<br />
and my learning about history and knowing how I feel and what I believe to make the world a better place,<br />
You may not understand how I want to make a better place, you may not understand my art, but I do understand and have a sense of what I want.<br />
While I left you because I felt like everyone left me in the dust without any support without any kind of things I owned before and needed to go back to the family who I needed space from at the time I walked away with you who tried to help me at the time<br />
so I can get my spoonful energy back and reconvene myself to the world,<br />
I know I hurt many people, I know I hurt by not talking that much to first the family in my life, and being silent to all a way long time,<br />
I know I triggered everyone from either leaving without letting anyone know to triggering in many other ways,<br />
when it comes to triggers, we can love and be loved, but there needs to be communication in every relationship especially when communication gives and creates agreements of supported decision making within those relationships I choose to have agreements with,<br />
between me and the people I choose in my life for support and what kinds of things I need for support even as a disabled person with being autistic.<br />
Having support from people means my anxiety is low, means I am in control of what I want regardless, and means everyone understands me, and understands what makes me tick and what doesn&#8217;t.<br />
And with that being said, even with bleeding love coming from our veins, it just pushes us closer to the support we all need in our lives.<br />
I hope you understand,<br />
I hope you know I love you,<br />
I hope you know what support really is.<br />
And, most importantly, I hope you know how much I love&#8230;</p>

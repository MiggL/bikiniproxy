After you exit the grove you can pass underneath the southern face of the peak Javorak and reach the foot of the serpentines leading to the top. There is a spring there, and a large concrete trough where you can replenish your water supply. From there to the observatory the view encompasses the mountains of Visočica, Treskavica, Jahorina, Trebević, and in the distance you can see the mountains Maglić, Bioč and Durmitor. It takes around three hours to reach the peak. You can take a break at the observatory, in the mountaineers' room. On your way back, downhill, you will quickly reach Štinji do, Kuća spasa, and finally Babin do. In winter, Babin do is packed with skiers and picnic-goers.</p>","primaryImage":{"author":"planinarenje.ba","source":"Terra Dinarica","id":"21896823"},"geometry":"18.295225,43.683300,1481

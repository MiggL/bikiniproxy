      <article>
<p class="content has-dropcap"> Throughout my career, my work has focused on complexity—the relations among the multiple factors that enter into any artwork or art historical process, and how these relations in turn connect to each other. Like many historians of Chinese painting, I conduct research in a range of time periods; more unusually, I also work on other media, including decorative arts, print media, calligraphy, and urban planning. I am particularly interested in taking painting out of its usual artificial isolation in modern scholarship from other artistic practices and the visual environment. The landmarks of my evolving research landscape are chronotopes: late nineteenth-century Shanghai, mid-eighteenth-century Yangzhou, late seventeenth-century Jiangnan, late sixteenth-century Shaoxing, fifteenth-century Beijing, Beijing ca. 1300, and north-central China in the tenth and eleventh centuries. (Previously, I have also been active in the modern/contemporary area.) In addition to my historical research, I also publish regularly on theory, method, and historiography. I take the position that art history today is hobbled by the epistemological deference to Enlightenment philosophy of the founders of the modern discipline, and that a healthy future for the discipline will require a shift toward active dialogue with contemporary scientific thinking and with the conceptual heritages of non-Western traditions.</p>
                <p class="content">Recent publications include the foreword essay to the edited volume <span class="italic">Qing Encounters: Artistic Exchanges between China and the West</span> (Getty Research Institute, 2015), a discussion of pictorial responses to the trauma of the fall of the Ming dynasty in the prizewinning museum catalog, <span class="italic">The Artful Recluse: Painting, Poetry, and Politics in 17th Century China</span> (Santa Barbara Museum of Art, 2012), and a macrohistorical view of Chinese painting&rsquo;s development from the eighth to the tenth century in <span class="italic">10th Century China and Beyond: Art and Visual Culture in a Multi-Centered Age</span> (University of Chicago, 2012). Two essays, one on ornament (in the edited volume, <span class="italic">Histories of Ornament: From Global to Local</span>) and the other on the visual perception of images (in the edited volume, <span class="italic">What Images Do</span>) are in press.</p>
                <p class="content">My first book was <span class="italic">Shitao: Painting and Modernity in Early Qing China</span> (2001), also published in Chinese translation in both simplified character and full character editions. This study, the only major monograph on the artist in English, maps out the complexity of the artist&rsquo;s diverse practice through successive focuses on his different social roles as scholar, remnant subject of the Ming dynasty, artist-entrepreneur, religious-philosophical thinker, and private person. By showing one man&rsquo;s modern engagement with the contingencies of the present, the book makes a case for modernity as one dimension of Chinese history ca. 1700. Now out of print, the book is available for free download on my faculty page. My second book was <span class="italic">Sensuous Surfaces: The Decorative Object in Early Modern China</span> (2010), a project supported by a Guggenheim fellowship. This book identifies conceptual approaches to the treatment of surface that were shared by artisans and designers working in different decorative mediums. The book is the first to have identified a system separate from taste that underpins the decorative arts of a given period. I am currently writing a book-length study of the tenth-century paleographer, calligrapher, architect, and painter, Guo Zhongshu (928-977), who is the earliest Chinese artist whose life can be reconstructed in any detail. I am also near to completing a book of theoretical essays provisionally entitled &ldquo;ARTWORK: Topologies of Artistic Form.&rdquo; </p>
                <p class="content">In the last few years years I have become deeply involved in the development of <span class="italic">IFA Portals</span>, an accumulating series of content-rich thematic websites that will be made available to the general public in September 2016. For the <span class="italic">Historiography</span> portal, I have written a book-length study, &ldquo;Historical Writing on Art: A Cross-Cultural History.&rdquo;This evolving text has been used for several years in the team-taught course on practices of art history that incoming MA students take during their first semester. On the <span class="italic">Chinese Pictorial Art</span> portal, I am &ldquo;publishing&rdquo; a lecture course &ldquo;How Chinese Paintings See the World,&rdquo; which traces out the evolving epistemology of Chinese painting over its entire history and in the process presents a new macrohistorical framework for the study of Chinese painting.The lecture course is accompanied by a glossary of around 300 terms, each of whose cross-referenced entries includes suggestions for further reading identified largely by Institute students. Scholarly publishing is changing rapidly in the digital age, and these two ventures are both experiments in new modes of publication.</p>
                <p class="content">Outside NYU, I have several ongoing commitments. In China, where I studied at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing at the end of the 1970s, I am closely involved with the newly established art history department at Zhejiang University, and am on the advisory board of their journal. In France, I have twice been a visiting professor at l&rsquo;École pratique des Hautes Études and am on the advisory committee of the leading journal, <span class="italic">Arts asiatiques</span>. I also served two terms on the international committee reviewing the Collège de France (2011-2014). In the United States, since 2012 I have been a member of a Yale-based interdisciplinary research group working toward a book on the Chinese polymath, Xu Wei (1521-1593). The project is among other things an experiment in a new mode of scholarly writing, since we are collectively writing all the many essays long and short that will make up the book. My most longstanding commitment in the United States, however, is to the journal <span class="italic">RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics</span>, of which I am a contributing editor. Since 1989 I have published several articles and essays in the journal, and edited an influential thematic issue, <span class="italic">Intercultural China</span>, in 1999.</p>
                <p class="content">I regularly review fellowship applications for the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, and am committed to supporting <span class="italic">The Art Bulletin</span>, where I have published several reviews and a major essay; I also served on the National Committee for the History of Art from 2002 to 2008. However, I am not very widely involved in the established institutions of the art history discipline, preferring instead to invent new ones such as the <span class="italic">Chinese Object Study Workshops</span>. This highly successful Mellon-supported program makes it possible for two groups of graduate students from around the country each year to spend a week studying a focused body of Chinese art under the supervision of professors, curators, and conservators. Along the same lines, although I have given invited lectures and conference keynotes at many institutions in the U.S. and internationally, I have become disenchanted with the lecture as a format and am much more interested in establishing innovative forums where more dynamic and substantive discussion can take place. To this end, in 2011 with my colleague Hsueh-man Shen I established the <span class="italic">China Project Workshop</span> at the Institute. At this very well attended and lively monthly forum, which provides a focus for specialists in Chinese art in and around New York, each meeting&rsquo;s presentation is only 30 minutes but the discussion lasts for 60 minutes or longer. All are welcome.</p>

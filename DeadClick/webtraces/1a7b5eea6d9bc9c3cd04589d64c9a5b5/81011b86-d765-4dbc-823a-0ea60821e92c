    <p class="x1st-paragraph"><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he assessment of the obese child or adolescent is critical in the treatment of childhood obesity. The assessment is based on a wide variety of factors including age, sex, family history, developmental stage, ethnicity, and social environment. Each of these factors will influence the treatment goal, the selection of type of treatment, and the course of therapy. Obesity is a complex disease, and even with excellent adherence to treatment recommendations, progress may be slow. Because of the extended time that children may need to be in treatment, the assessment must include a careful review of family lifestyle patterns and the child’s social environment.</p>

    <p class="column-head" id="toc_marker-14-4">UNDERSTANDING BMI</p>

    <p class="x1st-paragraph"><span class="drop-cap">B</span>ody mass index (BMI) is a number calculated from a person’s weight and height. BMI is a reliable indicator of body fatness for most people. Although BMI does not measure body fat directly, it has been shown to correlate to direct measures of body fat (e.g, underwater weighing). BMI is an inexpensive and easy-to-perform method of screening for weight categories that may lead to health problems. BMI can be used as a screening tool to identify possible weight problems for adults; however, BMI is not a diagnostic tool and should never be used as such. It is important to remember that BMI is not a direct measure of body fatness and that BMI is calculated from an individual’s weight, which includes both muscle and fat. As a result, some individuals may have a high BMI but not a high percentage of body fat. For example, highly trained athletes may have a high BMI because of increased muscularity rather than increased body fatness. To determine if excess weight is a health risk, a healthcare provider would need to perform further assessments. These assessments might include skinfold thickness measurements, evaluations of diet, physical activity, and family history, and other health screenings. BMI can be calculated using either English or metric equivalents (CDC, 2011b).</p>

    <p class="body">The formula for calculating BMI with the <span class="italic" xml:lang="en-US">metric</span> system is:</p>

    <p class="body">kg ÷ (m)2</p>

    <p class="body">Using the metric system, the formula for BMI is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Because height is commonly measured in centimeters, dividing height in centimeters by 100 will give height in meters. The easiest way to calculate BMI is to divide the weight by height, then divide by height again. Dividing by height twice is the same as using a squared height measurement. For example, given a weight of 68 kg, and a height of 1.65 m (165 cm ÷ 100), the calculation of BMI would be:</p>

    <p class="body1">68 ÷ 1.65 ÷ 1.65 = 24.98 BMI units</p>

    <p class="body">The formula for calculating BMI with the <span class="italic" xml:lang="en-US">English</span> system is:</p>

    <p class="body1">[lbs ÷ (in)<span class="super">2</span>] x 703</p>

    <p class="body">With the English system, calculate BMI by dividing weight in pounds (lbs) by height in inches (in.) squared, and multiplying the result by a conversion factor of 703. For example, given a weight of 150 lbs, and a height of 5’5”or 65 in., calculation of BMI would be:</p>

    <p class="body1">(150 ÷ 65 ÷ 65) x 703 = 24.96 BMI units</p>

    <p class="body">For adults 20 years old and older, BMI is interpreted using standard weight status categories that are the same for all ages and for both men and women. For children and teens, on the other hand, the interpretation of BMI is both age and sex specific.</p>

    <p class="column-subhead" id="toc_marker-14-4-1">Use of BMI in Children</p>

    <p class="body">Experts in the field of childhood obesity have recommended that BMI be used as the preferred measure for evaluating obesity in children and adolescents 2 to 19 years of age. Weight for length is still recommended to assess children less than 2 years of age. BMI expresses the weight-for-height relationship as a ratio: weight (kg)/height (m2). BMI is recommended as a measure for evaluating obesity for several reasons. It is easily obtained, is highly correlated with body fat percentage, and can correctly identify the fattest individuals (e.g., greater than the 95th percentile) with acceptable accuracy (Krebs et al., 2007). Table 6-1 shows the BMI interpretations for adults aged 20 years and older. Although the BMI number is calculated the same way for children and adults, the criteria used to interpret the meaning of the BMI number for children and teens are different from those used for adults. For children and teens, BMI age and sex specific percentiles are used because the amount of body fat changes with age and differs between girls and boys. The CDC growth charts take these differences into account and allow the BMI number to be translated into a percentile for a child’s sex and age. Table 6-2 shows the interpretation of BMI percentiles for children 2 to 19 years of age. Figure 6-1 shows an example of a 10-year-old boy and how to interpret the different BMI numbers using the CDC growth chart (CDC, 2008). The purpose of this figure is to illustrate how to interpret the BMI. BMI for females would be interpreted the same way.</p>

    <p class="body">Work by Freedman et al. (2007) showed that children with extreme obesity were increasing in prevalence and that these children were at higher risk for cardiovascular diseases. The AMA Expert Committee (Barlow, 2007) indicated there was adequate evidence to show that children whose BMI was greater than the 99th percentile were at the greatest risk for comorbidities associated with childhood obesity. Since the CDC growth charts do not have a cut point for the 99th percentile, Table 6-3 shows the cut points for this level. Practitioners can use these numbers to identify extremely high-risk children and implement a higher degree of assessment and treatment.</p>

    <p class="column-subhead" id="toc_marker-14-4-2">BMI Rebound</p>

    <p class="body">BMI changes substantially with age. After about 1 year of age, BMI-for-age begins to decline and it continues falling during the preschool years until it reaches a minimum around 4 to 6 years of age. After 4 to 6 years of age, BMI-for-age begins a gradual increase through adolescence and most of adulthood. The rebound or increase in BMI that occurs after it reaches its lowest point is referred to as adiposity rebound or BMI rebound. This is a normal pattern of growth that occurs in all children. The age when the BMI rebound occurs may be a critical period in childhood for the development of obesity as an adult. An early BMI rebound, occurring before 4 to 6 years of age, is associated with obesity in adulthood. However, studies have yet to determine whether the higher BMI in childhood is truly adipose tissue versus lean body mass or bone. Additional research is needed to further understand the impact of early BMI rebound on adult obesity.</p>

    <p class="column-head" id="toc_marker-14-5">OTHER ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES</p>

    <p class="x1st-paragraph"><span class="drop-cap">M</span>any clinicians and researchers use other measures of body composition, including skinfold measures and waist circumferences. The Expert Committee on Clinical Guidelines for Overweight in Adolescent Preventive Services (Krebs et al., 2007) reviewed the use of these measures as to whether they provide important clinical information beyond that obtained from using the BMI.</p>

    <p class="column-subhead" id="toc_marker-14-5-1">Skinfold Measures</p>

    <p class="body">Although skinfold measures are predictive of total body fat in children and adolescents, they are often difficult to measure and require expertise in assessment techniques. Additionally, they are not feasible in routine medical care and reference data are not readily available. Skinfold measures can be used in intervention programs to provide an additional measure of body composition change; however, the Expert Committee on Clinical Guidelines for Overweight in Adolescent Preventive Services (Krebs et al., 2007) did not recommend their use in routine clinical assessment.</p>

    <p class="column-subhead" id="toc_marker-14-5-2">Waist Circumference</p>

    <p class="body">Waist circumference measures assess visceral adiposity and can track with cardiovascular disease and metabolic risk factors. These measures are easier to evaluate than skinfold measurements. They are used to assess obesity in adults; however, it is not known what waist-circumference percentile clinicians should use and what actions are indicated. The Expert Committee, therefore, withheld recommending the routine use of waist circumference measurements because of incomplete information and the lack of specific guidelines for clinical use. In the future, they may be able to provide an adjunct to identifying children at increased risk for metabolic comorbidities.</p>

    <p class="column-head" id="toc_marker-14-6">ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES</p>

    <p class="x1st-paragraph"><span class="drop-cap">S</span>creening for obesity risk is an ongoing process. It starts with BMI evaluation, and then incorporates evaluation of medical conditions and risks, current behaviors, family attitudes, and psychosocial situations. Based on this information, clinicians can provide obesity prevention or obesity treatment. In general, children with BMI below the 85th percentile will benefit from prevention counseling, which will guide them toward healthier behaviors or reinforce current healthy behaviors. This counseling should be framed as growing healthy bodies rather than achieving a specific weight. Some children whose BMI is in the overweight category require special attention. Steps in assessment include BMI evaluation, medical screening, weight-related problems assessment, laboratory testing, and behavior assessment.</p>

    <p class="column-subhead" id="toc_marker-14-6-1">BMI Evaluation</p>

    <p class="body">BMI calculation and plotting should be done at least once a year to identify current weight category.</p>

    <p class="column-subhead" id="toc_marker-14-6-2">Medical Screening</p>

    <p class="body">Medical screening includes assessing parental obesity, family medical history, and blood pressure.</p>

    <p class="column-third-head" id="toc_marker-14-6-2-1">Parental Obesity</p>

    <p class="body">Parental obesity is one of the strongest risk factors in childhood obesity that persists into adulthood. Genetic predisposition can play an important role in the development of obesity. Familial risks for obesity, especially parental obesity, should prompt the provider to implement prevention and intervention practices to form healthier habits at an early stage.</p>

    <p class="column-third-head" id="toc_marker-14-6-2-2">Family Medical History</p>

    <p class="body">A positive family history includes incidence of early cardiovascular disease, parental hype­choles­­ter­o­lemia, parental hypertension, or a first- or second-degree relative with type 2 diabetes (siblings, parents, aunts, uncles, and grandparents). Providers should regularly review and update the family history, especially for at-risk children.</p>

    <p class="column-third-head" id="toc_marker-14-6-2-3">Blood Pressure</p>

    <p class="body">Elevated systolic blood pressure is seen in 13% of obese children. Blood pressure should be checked at all health supervision visits. It is important to use the correct cuff size for obese children. Many pediatric offices do not have the larger cuff sizes needed to obtain accurate measures. Children’s and adolescents’ blood pressure evaluation should be based on age, gender, and height. Blood pressure &gt; 90th percentile for age/gender/height is considered at-risk. Blood pressure &gt; 95th percentile for age/gender/height is considered hypertension if elevated on three or more occasions, as repeated measurement may be needed to rule out elevated blood pressure due to anxiety from being in a clinical setting (Krebs et al., 2007).</p>

    <p class="column-subhead" id="toc_marker-14-6-3">Physical Examination</p>

    <p class="body">A medical history and physical examination for current obesity-related conditions should be performed. A review of systems and a physical exam is one way to assess for many of these conditions; however, some of the comorbidities have no signs or symptoms (Barlow, 2007).</p>

    <p class="column-third-head" id="toc_marker-14-6-3-1">Sleep Problems</p>

    <p class="body">Although most sleep problems in children are related to asthma, obstructive sleep apnea can also lead to sleep problems and pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, children who have sleep disturbances have poor attention spans, poorer academic performance, and enuresis. Symptoms include loud snoring with pauses in breathing, restless sleep, and daytime sleepiness. A physical exam may show tonsillar hypertrophy. However, sleep apnea can still occur after the removal of tonsils and adenoids. It may be necessary to refer these patients to a pulmonologist for a sleep study (polysomnography) to determine if they require continuous positive airway pressure therapy during sleep (Barlow, 2007).</p>

    <p class="column-third-head" id="toc_marker-14-6-3-2">Respiratory Problems</p>

    <p class="body">Asthma occurs more frequently among obese children. In fact, shortness of breath and exercise intolerance (exercise-induced asthma) may be more symptomatic of asthma than of the child just being out of shape. Patients and families may need help in managing asthma symptoms during physical activity (Barlow, 2007).</p>

    <p class="column-third-head" id="toc_marker-14-6-3-3">Gastrointestinal Problems</p>

    <p class="body">Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition that has seen a significant increase in prevalence in obese children. NAFLD includes simple steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and liver cirrhosis resulting from fatty liver disease. NAFLD usually has no symptoms, although some patients may present with right upper quadrant abdominal pain or tenderness. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels are usually elevated and can be used as good screening tests for NAFLD. ALT or AST levels two times the normal levels should prompt a consult with a hepatologist (Barlow, 2007).</p>

    <p class="body">Gallstones are also seen more frequently in obese individuals. Additionally, rapid weight loss increases the risk for gallstones. Patients with gallstones may present with intermittent episodes of intense pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, but milder pain can also occur. On physical exam, this area may also be tender to palpation. Ultrasonography can help to confirm the diagnosis.</p>

    <p class="column-third-head" id="toc_marker-14-6-3-4">Endocrine Disorders</p>

    <p class="body">Type 2 diabetes is the most serious comorbidity of childhood obesity, with more than 45% of new diabetes diagnoses in children being type 2, as opposed to type 1. Many patients will not have symptoms such as polyuria or polydipsia; therefore, laboratory screening may be the only way to identify risk. Risk factors include: BMI &gt; 85th percentile; family history of diabetes; Black, Hispanic, or Native American background; polycystic ovarian syndrome; acanthosis nigricans; or cardiovascular risk factors. A fasting glucose level of &gt; 126 mg/dL or random glucose level of &gt; 200 mg/dL indicates diabetes, while a fasting glucose level of &gt; 100 mg/dL is considered pre-diabetes.</p>

    <p class="body">Females with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are more likely to be obese. Infrequent menstrual periods, hirsutism, excessive acne, and acanthosis nigricans are symptoms of PCOS. A referral to a specialist (e.g., adolescent medicine, endocrinologist, or gynecologist) may be necessary for treatment.</p>

    <p class="column-third-head" id="toc_marker-14-6-3-5">Cardiovascular Risks</p>

    <p class="body">Lipid level abnormalities are common among obese children. A fasting lipid profile should be obtained when BMI is &gt; 85th percentile even in the absence of other risk factors. Total cholesterol levels of &lt; 170mg/dL are acceptable, levels of 170-199 mg/dL are in the borderline category, and levels of &gt; 200 mg/dL are considered high. Low-density-lipoprotein levels (LDL) of &lt; 110 mg/dL are acceptable, levels of 110-129 mg/dL are borderline, and levels of &gt; 130 mg/dL are high. Referral to a dietitian can be helpful in guiding patients and families regarding dietary changes to reduce saturated fats and achieve a healthier nutritional intake (Barlow, 2007).</p>

    <p class="column-third-head" id="toc_marker-14-6-3-6">Orthopedic Disorders</p>

    <p class="body">Two orthopedic disorders are seen more commonly in obese children. These include Blount disease (tibia vara) and slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Blount disease presents with visible bowing of the lower extremity and is diagnosed by X-ray. It occurs most often after 8 years of age. A referral to an orthopedic surgeon can determine how to best treat this condition. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis occurs between 9 and 16 years of age and more often in boys than girls. It occurs in the pubertal process before the fusion of the epiphyseal plates and completion of linear growth. The child usually presents complaining of hip or knee pain and pain when walking. On physical exam, hip range of motion will be impaired. If confirmed by X-ray, a referral to an orthopedic surgeon is essential to correct the problem (Barlow, 2007).</p>

    <p class="column-third-head" id="toc_marker-14-6-3-7">Skin Conditions</p>

    <p class="body">Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is present in 10% of White and 50% of Black obese children. Children with AN present with a dark pigmented skin that is rough to the touch. It is most common in the neck and axillary area. Many parents complain of a dirty neck that will not come clean even with scrubbing. The presence of AN will diminish with weight loss.</p>

    <p class="column-subhead" id="toc_marker-14-6-4">Laboratory Testing</p>

    <p class="body">History and physical examination cannot effectively screen for abnormal cholesterol, NAFLD, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, these conditions must be identified by laboratory tests. The Expert Committee recommended that children with BMIs in the 85th-94th percentiles have a lipid panel performed. If risk factors are present, then fasting glucose and ALT and AST should be measured every two years for individuals aged 10 years and older. When the BMI is ≥ 95th percentile, the Committee suggests fasting glucose and ALT and AST every two years starting at 10 years of age, regardless of other risk factors. Elevation of ALT or AST on two occasions may indicate the need for further evaluation, probably with guidance from pediatric gastroenterology and hepatology experts. See Table 6-4 for a summary of recommended laboratory tests.</p>

    <p class="column-subhead" id="toc_marker-14-6-5">Behavior Assessment</p>

    <p class="body">Providers often find it helpful for parents and/or the child (depending on age) to complete a quick screening form in the waiting room prior to being seen. This allows the provider to target the assessment and counseling to potential problem areas. Figure 6-2 shows an example of the quick screening tool for children less than 8 years of age to be completed by the parents. The following provides an overview of screening for dietary patterns, physical activity, and physical inactivity.</p>

    <p class="column-third-head" id="toc_marker-14-6-5-1">Dietary Patterns</p>

    <p class="body">A brief assessment of foods and beverages typically consumed and the pattern of consumption can uncover modifiable behaviors associated with excess caloric intake. A dietitian can do a thorough evaluation when a detailed history is needed or after initial concerns have been addressed. Areas for assessment should be targeted based on weight, BMI, history, and family needs. Not all areas can be assessed or addressed in one visit. The following are areas that should be assessed during subsequent visits.</p>

    <ul class="calibre6">
      <li class="alpha">Frequency of eating food prepared outside the home, including restaurants, school and work cafeterias, fast-food establishments, and food purchased for “take-out”</li>

      <li class="alpha">Amount of sugar-sweetened beverages consumed each day</li>

      <li class="alpha">Amount of 100% juice consumed each day</li>

      <li class="alpha">Frequency and quality of breakfast</li>

      <li class="alpha">Energy density in the diet, such as high-fat foods</li>

      <li class="alpha">Exclusive breast-feeding to age 6 months and maintenance of breast-feeding after introduction of solids to age 12 months and beyond</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="column-third-head" id="toc_marker-14-6-5-2">Physical Activity</p>

    <p class="body">It is important to assess age-appropriate vigorous activity, both structured and unstructured, and routine activity. Areas to be addressed include (HHS, 2008):</p>

    <ul class="calibre6">
      <li class="alpha">Time spent doing moderate to vigorous physical activity each day to estimate whether the goal of 60 minutes of activity daily is met. This includes bicycling, swimming, skiing, running, tennis, basketball, or active free play.</li>

      <li class="alpha">Time spent in active play or physical activity each day to determine if the child has reached the recommended amounts of vigorous activity. One hour or more of activity should be of vigorous intensity at least three days a week</li>

      <li class="alpha">It is important that children partake in a variety of physical activity. Assess to determine if children are participating in muscle and bone-strengthening activity. This should be occurring at least three days per week. These activities include climbing, jumping, running, and hanging from or climbing on playground equipment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="body">Additionally, it is important to address barriers to physical activity. These barriers may include lack of adult role models, competing demands, unsafe environments, lack of recreation facilities, and inadequate access to quality daily physical activity. In fact, safety concerns such as heavy traffic, high crime rate, lack of equipment, lack of space, and urban development that favors cars are significant barriers to outside play. Once a barrier has been determined, providers can help parents and children develop plans for overcoming the barrier.</p>

    <p class="column-third-head" id="toc_marker-14-6-5-3">Physical Inactivity</p>

    <p class="body">Asking about hours of television viewing and other “screen time” will uncover a very important opportunity to modify behavior for improved energy balance. The number of hours of television watched each day has been associated with increased risk of obesity. A reduction in the number of hours can improve weight. Therefore, hours of television, video/DVD and video game viewing, and non-homework computer use should be limited to less than 2 hours per day with no television for children younger than 2 years of age (Spear et al., 2007).</p>

    <p class="column-subhead" id="toc_marker-14-6-6">Attitude Assessment</p>

    <p class="body">The complexity of obesity prevention and intervention lies less in the identification of target health behaviors and much more in the process of influencing families to change behaviors when habits, culture, and environment promote less physical activity and more energy intake. Clinicians can adopt specific techniques of interaction with families and create office systems that support ongoing commitment to obesity prevention. For example, some offices have found it helpful to develop a system where the triage nurse assesses BMI and flags the chart for the provider so the overweight or obese child will be identified at the beginning of the visit. Families may not recognize excess weight or the risk of obesity development. Or, they may be unwilling or unable to make behavior changes to improve eating and physical activity. Prior to providing counseling about new behaviors, clinicians should assess attitude, capacity, and motivation for change. Chapter 8 will discuss assessing a patient’s or family’s motivation to change.</p>

    <p class="body">Adam has a BMI of 25, which places him greater than the 95th percentile for age in the obese category. In addressing the mother’s concern over Adam’s snoring, your first thought is sleep apnea. Although this may be true, since he does not exhibit daytime sleepiness there may also be another cause that would need to be assessed (e.g., enlarged tonsils or adenoids).</p>

    <p class="body">Laboratory assessment should include fasting glucose and lipid profile, ALT, and AST (liver enzymes to rule out NAFLD).</p>

    <p class="body">A further assessment of Adam’s obesity might include:</p>

      <li class="alpha">A review of systems with a skin exam would check for acanthosis nigricans, which would indicate insulin resistance.</li>

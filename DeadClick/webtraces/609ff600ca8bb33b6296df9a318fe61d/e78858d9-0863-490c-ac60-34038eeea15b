But as I've written on my own blog if you leave the MFA without seeing any Japanese art that's entirely your own fault. They have huge banners for Hokusai hanging at the front of the building and the elevator that takes you there is wrapped in a Great Wave skin. The museum is massive so it's possible to run out of time to see any Japanese art but no one can accuse the MFA of not promoting Japanese art or only using it as a prop.

For this show, we are fundraising by Kickstarter crowdfunding until July 31 (http://kck.st/1Nj5jBZ). Backers contribute to our project from all over the world, not only from Japan. I will produce this show for people all over the world to rediscover that \"old-fashioned\" kimono is really a \"modern\" dress with huge capacity of variation.\n\nThis campaign has been funded, but we need more support to organize this show, and to conquer the \"old\" stereotypic view againt kimono. Please support us!\n\nIf you are interested in our project, please check our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/kimononyfw.\n\nThanks,\n\nHiro","canVote":false,"thread":"3946561223","forum":"japantimes","depth":0,"points":3,"moderationLabels":["links"],"isEdited":false,"sb":false}],"thread":{"feed":"https://japantimes.disqus.com/underneath_the_8216orientalist8217_kimono/latest.rss","author":"15292","dislikes":0,"likes":5,"message":"","isSpam":false,"createdAt":"2015-07-18T13:33:47","category":"6547","clean_title":"Underneath the \u2018Orientalist\u2019 kimono","id":"3946561223","signedLink":"http://disq.us/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.japantimes.co.jp%2F2015%2F07%2F18%2Fannouncements%2Funderneath-orientalist-kimono%2F&key=GDV5vLHwvTyAbuva5AFyyQ","isDeleted":false,"hasStreaming":false,"raw_message":"","isClosed":true,"link":"http://www.japantimes.co.jp/2015/07/18/announcements/underneath-orientalist-kimono/","slug":"underneath_the_8216orientalist8217_kimono","forum":"japantimes","identifiers":["806417 http://awsadmin.japantimes.co.jp/?post_type=culture&#038;p=806417","806417 http://www.japantimes.co.jp/?post_type=culture&#038;p=806417"],"posts":92,"moderators":[252347373,149757874,219685141,166369654,15292,112713461],"validateAllPosts":false,"title":"Underneath the &#8216;Orientalist&#8217; kimono","highlightedPost":null}},"order":"popular"}</script>

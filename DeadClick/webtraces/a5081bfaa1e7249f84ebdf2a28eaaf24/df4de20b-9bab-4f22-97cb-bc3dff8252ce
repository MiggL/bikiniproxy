  <p>Vailulu'u is an underwater volcano that lies approximately 20 miles east
    of Ta'u Island in American Samoa. Although this volcano will probably become
    the next Samoan island at some time in the future, its existence was only
    suspected until 1999 when it was first mapped using remote sonar methods.
    At that time, this massive volcano rose from a depth of 5000m to peak in
    a symmetrical cone about 600m deep. The bottom of the caldera, at a depth
    of about 1000m, was more-or-less flat when the volcano was last visited in
    March 2001. </p>
  <p>Just before our first submersible dive in March 2005, a quick
      multi-beam survey revealed the presence of a new submarine volcanic cone
      that had erupted from the floor of the caldera during the past four years.
      This new cone, named Nafanua for the Samoan goddess of war, now forms a new
      central summit with a depth of 708m well above the two major breaches in
      the crater wall. Continued growth could bring the summit close to the sea
      surface within decades, even though there is currently no evidence of active
      lava flows.</p>
  <p>Exploration of the volcanoes was done by submersible several times on two
    cruises during March and July of 2005. The <a href="../../technology/subs/pisces/pisces.html" title="Pisces V Submersible"><em>Pisces
    V</em></a>, a human-occupied submersible,
    made nine dives during the two cruises, collecting samples and taking measurements
    of the surrounding environment with a variety of equipment. The scientists
    inside the submersible recorded their observations during these dives, while
    the onboard camera gathered hours of deep-sea video. On each cruise, dives
    to the volcano revealed yellowish microbial mats draped over crumbly pillow
    lavas. Warm water, emanating from between the pillows elevated the temperature
    by only a few degrees. </p>
  <p>Remarkably, the crevices at this site are occupied
      by thriving aggregations of cutthroat (synaphobranchid) eels that swarm in
      the water column when the submersible touches the sea floor. These eels,
      which have now been identified as <em>Dysommina rugosa</em>, are known from
      trawl samples in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, but have never before
      been studied in their natural habitat. Although they were the only common
      metazoan (multicellular) animals occupying these low-temperature hydrothermal
      vents, preliminary work indicates that they use the vent only as a place
      to live. They seem to feed not on chemosynthetic bacteria, but on crustaceans
      that pass by Nafanua's summit in the currents.</p>

  <p>Currents, water flow and the movement of hydrothermal fluids inside and
    around the crater were monitored using a fluorescent dye release, and current
    meters deployed on the peaks and breaches of Vailulu'u. The submersible deployed
    the dye near the main crater floor hydrothermal vent field, enabling scientists
    inside to monitor the dispersal and flushing of the dyed fluid over 10-days
    on site. Oceanographic sampling of the water column was also conducted
    on separate cruises using over-the-side <a title="CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth) Equipment" href="../../technology/tools/sonde_ctd/sondectd.html">CTD</a> equipment. Understanding fluid
    movement around the volcano offers unique insights into thermal and chemical
    fluxes, nearby biological communities, and processes that couple the hydrothermal

  <p>Hydrothermal fluids and particulates accumulating in the Vailulu'u crater
    are released to the open ocean through a complex crater ventilation process.
    Buoyant hydrothermal plumes rise only to the height of the summit because
    of a steep density gradient in the water column at that depth. Clear oceanic
    water is driven through the NW and SW breaches by currents and tides. As
    this water sinks into the deep moat surrounding Nafanua, it displaces the
    turbid hydrothermal waters, forcing them to billow upward. Crater waters
    are mostly expelled through the SE breach, but other sections of the crater
    wall are probably involved as well, especially at low tides, when the hydrothermal
    plume collapses and forms a cloudy ring around Vailulu'u summit. </p>
  <p>The distribution of hydrothermal fluids in the crater and the flow of water
    around the volcano creates several distinct habitats with distinct biological
    communities. The outer flanks of the volcano support hard-bottom epifauna
    (animals living on or associated with the seafloor) dominated by octocorals,
    sponges and occasional echinoderms. This community is richest near the peak
    of the volcano, where fast currents provide the best flow and feeding conditions.
    On the inside edges of the Southern breaches, where clean seawater spills
    into the volcano, there is a dense population of small stalked sponges, yet
    to be identified. These sponges serve as an excellent indicator of chemical
    conditions, as they do not occur in the turbid waters where hydrothermal
    fluids from the volcano billow upward near the crater walls. These relatively
    lush communities on the summit of Vailulu'u contrast markedly with the region,
    dubbed the &quot;Moat of Death,&quot; that surrounds the base of Nafanua on the crater
    floor. Here, where the waters are turbid and acidic, the sea floor
    is littered with the carcasses of fish, squids and crustaceans. The only
    living animals found in this zone were bright red polychaetes (marine bristle
    worms) that swarmed around the rotten fish carcasses, where they may consume
    bacteria. </p>

  <p>Vailulu'u and Nafanua produce substantial quantities of hydrothermal fluids
    and particulates that decrease visibility inside most of the crater and locally
    cause near-bottom water pH to fall as low as 5.1. The sources of hydrothermal
    particulates are not clearly understood, even though submersible observations
    identified three distinct hydrothermal vent complexes inside the crater.
    Low-temperature vents at the summit of Nafanua are one of three distinct
    vent complexes located in an array that coincides with the epicenters of
    recently recorded volcano-tectonic earthquakes. The hottest vents (up to
    85&deg;C) were found at the foot of the northern crater wall, where they
    formed a zone of venting in several fields. Low salinities in the hydrothermal
    fluids suggest they form as steam in a boiling reaction zone that then condenses,
    mixes with other waters, and vents. These fields also release
    substantial quantities of an oil-like liquid, most likely CO<sub>2</sub>,
    that probably contributes to the acid waters in this region of the crater.
    Nafanua summit vents may be fed from a weak, deep rooted hydrothermal source
    or represent the final cooling stages of this new volcano. Another type of
    low temperature vent (ambient to about 28&deg;C) produces Iron Oxide chimneys.
    The largest field of these is located on the inner South crater wall. Both
    kinds of low-temperature hydrothermal vents were also found on the west rift
    of Vailulu'u, outside the crater and down to a depth of at least 1700m. </p>	
  <p>Overall, Vailulu'u has a very dynamic and robust hydrothermal system that
    was estimated to release the heat equivalent of 20 black smokers from the
    East Pacific Rise (<a title="http://www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/02fire/logs/yr_sum/yr_sum.html" href="http://www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/02fire/logs/yr_sum/yr_sum.html">see
    Ring Of Fire 2002 Exploration</a>).
    It is likely that the total heat output of the mid-ocean ridges is significantly
    larger than the total heat output of all seamounts, but the total intensity
    of venting at Vailulu'u shows that seamounts may be significant players in
    the heat budget of the solid earth as well. These systems certainly
    have a substantial impact on defining the local chemical marine environment
    and the development of some unique ecosystems like Eel City or the &quot;Moat
    of Death.&quot; </p>
  <p>Vailulu'u and its hydrothermal vents offered an exciting opportunity to explore
    the complex interface between the lithosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere. These 
	three spheres are linked through the circulation of seawater through volcanic - 
	hydrothermal systems, and the complex couplings of these hydrothermal systems 
	with the oceans. Above all, however, Vailulu'u demonstrated that ocean exploration 
	is alive and well; there are still exciting mysteries to be discovered in the 
	deep oceans, and many interesting scientific puzzles remain to be solved. </p>

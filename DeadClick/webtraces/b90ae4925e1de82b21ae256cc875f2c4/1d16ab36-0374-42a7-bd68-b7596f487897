The strigoi are believed to suck the milk from mothers and cows (the inspiration for Stoker\u0026rsquo;s blood-sucking vampires), which is why Romanian peasants have long protected their livestock by smearing their horns with garlic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut beyond folklore, garlic is a must on every Romanian\u0026rsquo;s plate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e Garlic is a must on every Romanian\u0026rsquo;s plate \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne evening I was feasting with friends at \u003ca href=\"http://www.conaculbratescu.ro/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eConacul Brătescu\u003c/a\u003e, a Romanian restaurant located a 10-minute walk from \u003ca href=\"http://www.bran-castle.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBran Castle\u003c/a\u003e (the inspiration for Stoker\u0026rsquo;s Dracula\u0026rsquo;s Castle). A group of tourists on the next table were watching with inquisitive eyes as we smothered our trout and polenta in \u003cem\u003emujdei\u003c/em\u003e, a pungent Romanian sauce made from crushed garlic cloves that are salted and vigorously mixed with water and sunflower oil, or yoghurt in some cases. While many people eschew garlic in their food for fear of smelling of it, Romanians have a cult-like appreciation for the plant. The principle is simple: the more, the better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It just doesn\u0026rsquo;t taste the same without,\u0026rdquo; my friend Alexandru Pavelescu exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05l3rvn\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwo more generous portions of mujdei were brought in and finished in a matter of minutes, both as a sauce for the fish or simply spread on bread.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDeemed irreplaceable in flavouring steaks and other foods, garlic has always been a widespread crop in Romania. In Copălău village in Botosani County, the aromatic plant is cultivated by more than 40% of the locals. Considered unique due to the remote settlement\u0026rsquo;s soil quality, the garlic of Copălău has gained fame both nationally and internationally \u0026ndash; so much so that the county\u0026rsquo;s agricultural authorities are preparing to register it as a product with a protected geographical indication.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e Garlic has long been thought of as a magical plant \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt a home level, garlic is used in \u003cem\u003eciorbă\u003c/em\u003e, the word for the country\u0026rsquo;s many soups containing vegetables and meat, such as \u003cem\u003eciorbă de burtă\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;(tripe soup) or its lighter version, \u003cem\u003eciorbă rădăuţeană\u003c/em\u003e made with chicken. Present on every menu, the popular skinless ground beef and pork sausages known as \u003cem\u003emici\u003c/em\u003e owe their juicy, savoury taste to the generous amount of garlic in the recipe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAside from being an essential ingredient in Romanian cuisine, garlic has long been thought of as a magical plant. On the eve of Saint Andrew (the patron saint of Romania) on 29 November, garlic is believed to keep you safe against strigoi and\u003cem\u003e moroi\u003c/em\u003e, evil spirits of those passed on that haunt the household of relatives still living. A Romanian Halloween of sorts, residents of rural areas both eat garlic and smear it on the corners of windows and doors to protect themselves. Rows of garlic can be seen hanging with the same purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05l3r5t\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Due to its curing properties as an alternative remedy, garlic has been given further symbolic attributes as a ritualistic plant, bearing an apotropaic role of protection,\u0026rdquo; said Ana Iuga, ethnologist at the \u003ca href=\"http://www.muzeultaranuluiroman.ro/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRomanian Peasant Museum\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e All the important transitions in life are accompanied by a set of rituals \u0026ndash;\u0026nbsp;garlic is the leitmotif behind them \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut it doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop here. In Romania, garlic is considered a more powerful (natural) medicine than most antibiotics, due to a compound called allicin (released when the garlic is chopped or crushed) that has similar properties as penicillin, and dishes such as garlic soup made with roasted garlic heads blended with carrots, onions, potatoes, parsnip and celery are served to combat the flu. Grandmothers and great-grandmothers pass down the tradition of smearing freshly halved garlic cloves on toast for both taste and health purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Tradition and folklore are deeply engrained into Romanian culture in a syncretism dating even before Christianity,\u0026rdquo; said Gabriela Solomon, co-founder of \u003ca href=\"http://mysecretromania.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy Secret Romania\u003c/a\u003e, during a garlic-themed culinary workshop. \u0026ldquo;All the important transitions in life \u0026ndash; birth, marriage and death \u0026ndash; are accompanied by a set of rituals that are preserved even by highly educated people. Garlic is the leitmotif behind them.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05l3s0c\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn keeping with this national belief that garlic has miraculous powers, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Festivalul-Usturoiului-in-Tinutul-Contelui-Dracula-649697225059102/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGarlic Festival\u003c/a\u003e, currently in its fifth year, takes place each September in the Tihuţa Pass in the B\u0026acirc;rgău mountains (Eastern Carpathians). This is where Transylvania meets Bukovina, long considered the gateway to the realm of Count Dracula as depicted in Bram Stoker\u0026rsquo;s novel under its former Hungarian name \u0026lsquo;Borgo Pass\u0026rsquo;. At the festival, traditional dishes with garlic are prepared, garlic wreaths are woven, and magic shows and spells are all part of the event.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, whether or not vampires really exist in Romania, garlic most definitely does, in its food, medicine and ancient folklore.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJoin over three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCTravel/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFacebook\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, or follow us on\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Travel\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTwitter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbc_travel/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eInstagram\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you liked this story,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=ear.bbc.email.we.email-signup\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003esign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

Horse-drawn carts are still a part of daily life, and local residents gather to trade their wares in a cobbled village square. At the heart of the village, a 15th-Century fortified church towers over the surrounding structures from its hilltop perch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInside the church grounds, along one of its fortification walls, is a small building with a room inside barely larger than a pantry. For 300 years, couples whose marriages were on the rocks would find themselves here, locked away for up to six weeks by the local bishop in hope that they would iron out their problems and avert a divorce.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05821f7\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt may sound like a nightmare \u0026ndash; but records show that this \u0026lsquo;marital prison\u0026rsquo; was rather effective.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e In the 300 years there has only been one divorce \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Thanks to this blessed building, in the 300 years that Biertan had the bishop\u0026rsquo;s seat we only had one divorce,\u0026rdquo; said Ulf Ziegler, Biertan\u0026rsquo;s current priest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, the small, dark prison is a museum complete with long-suffering mannequins. The room has low ceilings and thick walls, and is sparsely equipped with a table and chair, a storage chest and a traditional Saxon bed that looks small enough to belong to a child. As couples attempted to repair their marriages inside this tiny space, everything had to be shared, from a single pillow and blanket to the lone table setting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05821jg\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLutheranism, the religion of the Transylvanian Saxons, governed most aspects of life,\u0026nbsp;and although divorce was allowed under certain circumstances \u0026ndash; such as adultery \u0026ndash; it was preferred that couples attempt to save their union. So a couple seeking divorce would voluntarily visit the bishop, who would send them to the marital prison to see if their differences could be reconciled before they parted ways.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The prison was an instrument to keep society in the old Christian order,\u0026rdquo; explained Zielger, who noted that it also protected women and children, who were dependent on the family unit to survive. If a divorce did occur, the husband had to pay his ex-wife half of his earnings, but if he remarried and divorced again, the second wife was entitled to nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the 12th Century, \u003ca href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Transylvanian-Saxons\"\u003eSaxon settlers\u003c/a\u003e ‒ originally from areas that today are France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany ‒ were invited by Hungary\u0026rsquo;s King G\u0026eacute;za II to settle rural Transylvania and protect it against threats from Tatar and Ottoman invaders, as well as develop the area economically. Transylvanian Saxons were industrious craftspeople; Biertan became an important market town and cultural hub with a 5,000-strong population in 1510.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p058223r\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWalking through the streets of Biertan as the sun begins to disappear behind the rolling hills, a few locals sit outside drinking beers and a farmer moves his hay cart through the village. The imposing church, with its nine surrounding fortification towers, is illuminated by bright lights and its purpose evident: it was a central point for the early Saxon settlers ‒ a place of safety and worship.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe view from the church\u0026rsquo;s nearly 11m-high fortification walls next to the marital prison extends out across the village and surrounding countryside. Many current residents work their land using old-age farming techniques, and trade their wares to earn a living. Weather-worn shepherds can be spotted in the surrounding green hills herding sheep ‒ a scene that likely hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed much over the past several centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLife continues to move at a slow, meditative pace; however, these days there is less economic and religious pressure on struggling couples to remain together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05821pz\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The reason to remain together was probably not love. The reason was to work and to survive,\u0026rdquo; Ziegler said. \u0026ldquo;If a couple was locked inside for six weeks, it was very hard for them to have enough food the following year, so there was pressure to get out and to continue to work together.\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e We need to talk more, so we can find out what is important to us and what connects us \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eZiegler believes that, even today, the concept of a marital prison has potential lessons for any modern marriage.\u0026nbsp;And he\u0026rsquo;s not the only one: he says that he\u0026rsquo;s received requests from couples looking to use the prison to repair their own struggling marriages.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;In modern families, there is less and less time for each other, we are more selfish than our ancestors,\u0026rdquo; Ziegler said. \u0026ldquo;We suffer from loneliness, which is why today we need to talk more, so we can find out what is important to us and what connects us.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJoin over three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCTravel/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFacebook\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, or follow us on\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Travel\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTwitter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbc_travel/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eInstagram\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you liked this story,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=ear.bbc.email.we.email-signup\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003esign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

        "BodyHtml": "\u003cp\u003eLittle did I know that one my favourite piazzas in Romania was hiding a secret beneath its modern European facade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;d heard rumours that Piata Libertati (Liberty Square) in the city of Timisoara was the site of a magnificent Turkish bath during the Ottoman era (1552-1716). But I\u0026rsquo;d never seen any sign of that world other than a small plaque with Arabic writing on the wall of a nearby building. Then in September 2014 I returned to the city on Romania's western frontier and discovered something exciting: archaeologists had unearthed the 400-year-old bathhouse known as the Grand Hammam.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eExcavations were still underway but I could not wait to explore the treasures that had been uncovered. I started asking around and learned that archaeologists had found more than just the Turkish bathhouse. Crews were digging in several areas of the historic centre, and the city's Oriental past was literally emerging from the ground. I was downright giddy. It\u0026rsquo;s exciting to witness a city that you have come to know intimately reveal an entirely new facade and a new set of places to explore. It felt like time travel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{ \"pid\": \"p02q40xn\" }}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTimisoara was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in July 1552. Under the command of Albanian-born Kara Ahmed Pasha, an army of roughly 16,000 men took the city and soon transformed it into the capital of the Banat region. For more than 160 years, Timisoara was controlled directly by the sultan. The city was on the forefront of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian struggle for territory that would shape the region for centuries to come.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{ \"pid\": \"p02q418b\" }}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStanding in the Grand Hammam excavation area, I could see the ruins of ancient chamber areas and air circulation passages that were slowly being restored. I thought of the dozens of times I had visited Piata Libertati completely unaware of what lay below. The piazza is centrally located between Piata Unirii (Union Square), a popular meeting spot with bars and cafes, and Piata Operei (Opera Square), which hosts some of the city\u0026rsquo;s most important community and cultural activities. The two buzzing squares make Piata Libertati feel like an oasis of relative calm, its trees offering shade to anyone who cares to sit and watch life sweep past.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBack in the 17th Century, the piazza must have been an ideal spot for people watching, too. Turkish baths in various parts of the world continue to be more than just places for bathing and relaxation. They play a part in civic life by bringing people together in such an intimate setting, as well as a religious role in purifying the soul. The excavations at Piata Libertati revealed that the Grand Hammam contained 15 rooms arranged around a large central hall. The floor of the baths was suspended on brick pilasters \u0026ndash; square columns \u0026ndash; to allow the circulation of hot air, which was produced in an oven chamber. Each room was equipped with air passages and smoke chimneys. Outside, the area was surrounded by gardens and interior courts of nearby buildings, creating an atmosphere that was private and calming, and ideal for conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{ \"pid\": \"p02q40qw\" }}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStanding at the piazza on a chilly spring morning during an earlier visit, I wished the hammam was still there so I could warm up in its steamy interior. I wanted to explore the ruins that are changing the face of the city further, so I strolled over to Piata Sf Gheorghe (St George Square), less than 100m to the west. The piazza is a small square tucked between Viennese-style buildings. During previous visits to Timisoara, I\u0026rsquo;d often passed by it on my way to grab a snack at one of city's covrigi (pretzel) shops, pausing along the way to flick through the English-language books for sale on makeshift bookshelves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut important discoveries have recently been made in Piata Sf Gheorghe, too, leading Romanian archaeologist Florin Drasovean to proclaim the spot \u0026ldquo;the world of the gods, the world of the living and the dead world\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{ \"pid\": \"p02q41qx\" }}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the first half of the 18th Century, Captain Fran\u0026ccedil;ois Perette with the Imperial Austrian military, drew up a map of Timisoara on which he marked several key landmarks from the Ottoman period. One of the most important was the Grand Mosque of Timisoara. Evliya Celebi (1611-1682), a renowned travel writer from the Ottoman period, described the mosque in his journal as a \u0026ldquo;great sanctuary for prayer\u0026rdquo;. After the Austrian conquest in 1716, the mosque was transformed into a Christian church and later demolished. A new church built on the site erased nearly all signs of the mosque \u0026ndash; until 2014 excavations . After centuries in absentia, the mosque's foundation and artefacts from the period are finally emerging, allowing Drasovean to rediscover \u0026ldquo;the world of the gods\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026rsquo;s not all. In addition to the mosque, archaeologists digging in Piata Sf Gheorghe have uncovered the remains of wooden houses and aqueducts. The aqueducts were among the first urban water management systems to be constructed in Romania. While the Turks did not originally build them, they did organise them to supply water to public buildings. The wooden houses date back to the medieval period before the Turks arrived and were maintained until the Austrians began to modernise the city in the 18th Century. Archaeologists have also excavated 160 graves around the mosque, most containing commoners who were wrapped in a single piece of cloth in accordance with Islamic tradition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{ \"pid\": \"p02q40zn\" }}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo maintain peace and political control during the Ottoman period, the Turks accepted people of all faiths and ethnicities and did not interfere in locals\u0026rsquo; lives. While this kept Timisoara safe from within, the city still faced threats from the outside. So the Turks reinforced the city's defences. Taking advantage of the nearby rivers of Bega and Timis, the Turks created moats around the city, as well as a fortress. Towering above the water were walls up to 3m thick, guarded by Ottoman soldiers. The defences of Timisoara were so effective that when the army of Eugene of Savoy did conquer the city in 1716, it was because the Turks surrendered following a long siege and unusually bad weather.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eArchaeologists believe their recent discoveries are just the beginning. Timisoara's history dates back to antiquity and many secrets have yet to be unearthed \u0026ndash; giving all of us yet another good reason to visit the inviting piazzas of Timisoara.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere do you rank in our tribe of worldly readers?

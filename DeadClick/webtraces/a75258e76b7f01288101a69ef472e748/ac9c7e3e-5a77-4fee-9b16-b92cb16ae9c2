<h2>IRMA is an answer to a global demand for more socially and environmentally responsible mining.</h2>
<div id="primary">
<h3>IRMA Launch Phase 2018-2019: Putting the IRMA System into practice</h3>

<p>IRMA&rsquo;s Launch Phase is designed for learning, improving, and assuring the verification system is accountable to all stakeholder groups. During Launch, mines are offered an opportunity to apply for recognition of achievement in environmental and social responsibility. The new certification scheme will also give purchasers a pathway to connect with leading mines through their supply chains. Civil society stakeholders &mdash; workers, local communities and nonprofit nongovernment organizations &mdash; will have increased access to information and communication with mines willing to lead.</p>

<h4>Key Components of Launch:</h4>

<p>In early 2018, IRMA will offer:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#The Launch Phase Standard for Responsible Mining">The Launch Phase&nbsp;<em>Standard for Responsible Mining</em></a> (having incorporated input from public comment reviews in 2014 and 2016, field tests in the US and Zimbabwe, and working group efforts on the most challenging issues)</li>
	<li><a href="#Self-Assessment Tool (Optional)">A Self-Assessment tool for mines</a></li>
	<li><a href="#IRMA Map - An Interactive Responsible Mining Transparency Map">The IRMA Interactive Map</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Hosting a Global Dialogue">A Global Dialogue</a></li>
	<li><a href="#IRMA Membership">Membership options</a> and</li>
	<li><a href="#Independent Auditor Verification">Later in 2018, an independent auditor verification and scoring system</a></li>
</ul>

<p>IRMA is seeking constructive feedback on each of these elements and will apply learning to improve the system before offering mines full Certification and entry-level Candidate achievement status starting in 2019.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a id="The Launch Phase Standard for Responsible Mining" name="The Launch Phase Standard for Responsible Mining"><strong>The Launch Phase&nbsp;<em>Standard for Responsible Mining</em></strong></a></p>

<p>A&nbsp;first phase Standard, which offers metrics for responsible mining practices across a broad range of social, environmental and business practices. The <em>Standard for Responsible Mining</em> fundamentally is a shared definition of how &ldquo;responsible mining&rdquo; can be measured. While no individual stakeholder is likely to agree with all of the content therein, it represents ten years of good faith effort across diverse sectors to develop a shared vision. Launch Phase will test this definition and seek to improve to the benefit of all.</p>

<p><a id="Self-Assessment Tool (Optional)" name="Self-Assessment Tool (Optional)"><strong>Self-Assessment Tool (Optional)</strong></a></p>

<p>Mines may use IRMA&rsquo;s Self Assessment and Self Scoring (SASS) tool to determine their readiness for an audit and prepare documents ahead of the audit. While not required, it is recommended that mines use this tool to prepare themselves prior to investing resources in an audit. In 2018, mines Self Assessing may list themselves on the IRMA Map (see more below); this allows these mines a chance to identify their willingness to participate in the global dialogue on responsible mining and connect with interested purchasers/investors even before full scoring/certification begins.</p>

<p>All companies using the SASS tool will be encouraged to provide feedback to IRMA to improve the Standard and self-assessment process. The feedback is primarily for IRMA learning purposes, and individual responses will not be attributed without permission.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a id="IRMA Map - An Interactive Responsible Mining Transparency Map" name="IRMA Map - An Interactive Responsible Mining Transparency Map"><strong>IRMA Map - An Interactive&nbsp;Responsible Mining Transparency Map</strong></a></p>

<p><img alt="The IRMA Map" src="http://www.responsiblemining.net/images/uploads/content-images/IRMA_Map_graphic_no_quotes.jpeg?v=1518006007" style="width: 400px; height: 267px; float: left; margin: 10px;" />All stakeholders/rights-holders will be invited to participate in the IRMA&nbsp;Map. Mining companies, Purchasers and Civil Society groups will have the option to &ldquo;Get on the Map&rdquo; and demonstrate their role and interest in responsible mining as well as identify where they fall in the supply chain. &nbsp;</p>

<p>*Image on left is a sample.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mines can list their effort Self Assessing (see above) and later in auditor-verified scoring (see below).</li>
	<li>Purchasers/investors can list their interest to source from and engage with mines seeking to improve practices.</li>
	<li>Civil society (communities, NGOs, labor) can describe their work and interest to forward more responsible mining.</li>
</ul>

<p>This interactive map &ndash; a marketplace of ideas and values (defined broadly across sectors) -- will give interested purchasers and others increased information on the social and environmental performance of mines and will allow mines to better understand the expectations of purchasers and other stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a id="Hosting a Global Dialogue" name="Hosting a Global Dialogue"><strong>Hosting a Global Dialogue</strong></a></p>

<p>The map described above is one of several venues IRMA will offer to assure a fair and respectful discussion of the variety of issues associated with responsible mining. In addition to the map, IRMA will seek further public review on the metrics of the Standard that need to be improved (particularly from mines as they self-assess), and we will host working groups to address controversial issues needing cross-sector discussion to reach shared solutions.</p>

<p>IRMA will also be proactively collaborating with colleagues working to forward more responsible mining at the artisanal scale level (ASM mining) and with others working on materials retrieval/recycling. While IRMA&rsquo;s focus is to create an incentive for more responsible practices at industrial scale mines, we don&rsquo;t want to unintentionally have a negative impact on the equally important value for improvement in ASM and materials retrieval.</p>

<p><a id="IRMA Membership" name="IRMA Membership"><strong>IRMA Membership&nbsp;</strong></a></p>

<p>Membership in IRMA offers several benefits, the primary benefit being participation in IRMA&rsquo;s multi-stakeholder governance process. Companies, organizations and community representatives interested in the Board of Directors, committees (formal and ad hoc) and working groups will be able to join as members early in 2018. IRMA also welcomes Subscribers who want access to information and engagement but don&rsquo;t need member-voting rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a id="Independent Auditor Verification" name="Independent Auditor Verification"><strong>Independent Auditor Verification</strong></a></p>

<p>In mid-2018 IRMA will begin offering auditor-verified scoring of achievement against the IRMA Standard for Responsible Mining. Independent third-party auditors will be trained and accredited. Mines may choose to have an auditor review of their performance against the full Standard or just select chapters of particular interest (for their engagement with key purchasers/stakeholders).</p>

<p>In 2018 these scores will not be associated with particular IRMA achievement levels (e.g. &ldquo;certification&rdquo;) but rather will stand on their own as IRMA works with all stakeholders to learn and improve systems. Mines may choose to share their auditor-verified score on the IRMA Map (see above) and thus connect with purchasers, investors and other stakeholders interested in connecting with mines committed to this effort and transparency. During Launch Phase, participation in the global dialogue will itself be acknowledged as an achievement of leadership.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Modern societies rely on mining, minerals, and metals to function. Nearly everything in the built environment &ndash; from buildings to roads to computers and trains &ndash; contains materials extracted from the Earth&rsquo;s surface.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mining can provide important employment and financial opportunity for host communities. Mining is also a complex and intensive process that causes environmental and social change no matter where it occurs. Mining may impact the physical environment (e.g., loss of habitat, contamination of water) and local communities&rsquo; social and economic lives (e.g., displacement of livelihoods, cultural impacts). However, most negative social and environmental impacts are avoidable if companies operate according to leading standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) seeks to recognize mine sites practicing environmental and social responsibility and create further value and incentive for this effort. IRMA envisions a world where the mining industry respects the human rights and aspirations of affected communities, provides safe, healthy and supportive workplaces, minimizes harm to the environment, and leaves positive legacies.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Purpose of IRMA</h3>

<p>IRMA&rsquo;s purpose is to demonstrate value for such a world through a Standard that describes social and environmental performance, and a system that delivers recognition for achievement of benchmarks against that Standard. IRMA links investors and private sector purchasers of mined material with mines seeking to lead. IRMA&rsquo;s system offers accountability and credibility through multi-stakeholder governance and independent third-party verification.</p>

<h3>Responsible Mining</h3>

<p>Although some degree of disturbance is inevitable even in the best-managed mines, and in some cases &lsquo;no mining&rsquo; may be the best option, we believe that most negative social and environmental impacts are avoidable if companies operate according to the best possible standards. Elements of such responsible mining practices include:</p>

<p><strong>Mine location</strong>. Mine owners and operators need to carefully weigh land and resource use options and preserve ecologically and culturally significant areas.</p>

<p><strong>Environmental management. </strong>Where possible, mining operators need to reduce the environmental impact from habitat loss and pollution during all stages of mine development.</p>

<p><strong>Workers and affected communities</strong>. This includes issues related to the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples for mining, health and safety provisions, and sharing benefits more broadly.</p>

<p><strong>Corporate governance</strong>. Mine operators need to ensure transparency in revenue payments from companies to governments and report on progress made toward implementing responsible practices.</p>

<h3>The IRMA Standard</h3>

<p>The <em>Standard for Responsible Mining</em> is an integral piece of the IRMA certification system. It outlines a set of best-practice requirements that were developed and are being revised through multi-stakeholder processes. IRMA encourages mining companies to adhere to these responsible mining practices and to demonstrate compliance by participating in IRMA&#39;s independently verifiable responsible mining assurance system.</p>

	<P class="cnnBodyText"><br>CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Welcome to CNN 10.  I`m Carl Azuz.  We hope you`re at the beginning of a very good week.<br> <br>Getting started this Monday, it`s considered one of the most dangerous drugs in the world.  It factors in heavily to the heroin epidemic we`ve <br> <br> reported on in the U.S.  But it`s also blamed for deaths in Europe, Africa, and Australia.<br> <br>Fentanyl is a manmade painkiller.  The United Nations recently put restrictions on some of the chemicals used to make it.  It says fentanyl is <br> <br> the strongest painkiller in existence for medical use, but then it`s also highly addictive and especially dangerous when abused because it`s so <br> <br> powerful, many times stronger than even heroin itself.  <br> <br>Fentanyl used to be found only in pharmacies.  Now, it`s showing up in counterfeit pills, much of what`s being sold on the black market contains <br> <br> fentanyl.  It`s much more potent than prescription medications and it`s killing people who take it. <br> <br>One challenge for U.S. officials who are trying to stop its spread, the actual machines used to make the pills.  They`re arriving on American <br> <br> shores in a record numbers and they`re contributing to overdoses in every corner of the country.<br> <br>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<br> <br>SARA GANIM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It`s happening all over the country, in New Mexico, in Florida, in California.  People are dying from <br> <br> counterfeit pills made with a dangerous synthetic drug called fentanyl, a drug that`s 25 to 50 times stronger than heroin, up to 100 times more <br> <br> potent than morphine.<br> <br>JOHN MARTIN, SPECIAL AGENT, DEA:  People have died from ingesting what they think is a legitimate painkiller and it`s a counterfeit pill that contains <br> <br> fentanyl.<br> <br>GANIM:  The death of pop-icon Prince could turn out to be the most famous case of counterfeit pills.  Police reportedly found mislabeled pills laced <br> <br> with fentanyl in his home, the drug was found in his system.<br> <br>GANIM:  This is the tool drug dealers are using to make those pills, turning synthetic powder into something that looks just like prescription <br> <br> meds.<br> <br>MARTIN:  If you have counterfeit pills, you can`t make them without pill presses.<br> <br>GANIM:  As the DEA`s John Martin shows CNN pill presses are simply bought off in the Internet, most come from China.<br> <br>MARTIN:  Here`s a large industrial one for almost $5,000.<br> <br>GANIM:  The machines make pills so deceivingly accurate, even veteran agents have trouble telling the difference.  <br> <br>The machines themselves are not illegal, but buying them without proper registration is.  The number of illegal imports has spiked nineteen-fold <br> <br> since 2011.<br> <br>CHERYL DAVIES, ASSISTANT PORT DIRECTOR, CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION:  So you just put the product in here and you turn it.  And then it shoots out <br> <br> the -- <br> <br>GANIM (on camera):  This was seized?<br> <br>DAVIES:  This was seized, yes, and this machine came from China.<br> <br>GANIM (voice-over):  Cheryl Davies leads the anti-terrorism contraband team at America`s largest seaport, in Long Beach, California.<br> <br>Finding pill presses among millions of tons of goods is no small challenge.  One container here is processed every 7.8 seconds.<br> <br>Customs and Border Protection opened up its secret warehouse for CNN, showing us the seized pill press machines, with investigations under way to <br> <br> see whether they were legally imported.<br> <br>DAVIES:  We see a variety of machines.  They range from manual, little, manual machines that you can make one or two at a time,  All the way up to <br> <br> machines that can generate 170,000 per minute.  Huge, industrial-sized machines.  <br> <br>With all the overdoses that we`re seeing, the increase in overdoses over the last couple of years, I think these types of interceptions are <br> <br> extremely important.  They have a lot of impact on our communities.<br> <br>GANIM:  The ones they don`t catch end up in places like Lubbock, Texas.  Police raided and found a table-top pill press and nearly seven pounds of <br> <br> synthetic fentanyl.  It`s so dangerous, even to touch, that agents have to get into full hazmat gear.<br> <br>The DEA`s John Martin says pill presses have made it easier for drug dealers to make millions of dollars out of their homes.<br> <br>MARTIN:  They`re going to get on the dark net.  They will order fentanyl or some type of fentanyl-related compound.  It usually comes from China.  The <br> <br> setup is relatively cheap.<br> <br>GANIM:  For five to six thousand dollars, Martin says, someone could potentially sell $10 million of fake pills, pills that can be deadly.<br> <br>MARTIN:  It`s almost like playing Russian roulette.  It`s extremely dangerous.<br> <br>GANIM:  Sara Ganim, CNN, Long Beach, California.<br> <br>(END VIDEOTAPE)<br> <br>AZUZ:  If you got a frozen pizza in your house, have a look at the label before you bake it.  U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week <br> <br> that more than 21,000 pounds of frozen pizza had been recalled.  The foods involved are processed by the RBR Meat Company in California.  They are <br> <br> labeled Marketside supreme frozen pizza, and they were demonstrated by Wal- Mart centers in the American West, in California, Nevada, Utah and Washington.<br> <br>The government`s recall announcement said that no confirmations have been made that anyone`s actually gotten sick from the pizzas, but that the risk <br> <br> is high.  During routine testing of the foods, officials discovered they were contaminated with listeria.<br> <br>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<br> <br>SUBTITLE:  What is Listeria?<br> <br>ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Listeria is a bacteria that can be found in several different kinds of foods.  For example, <br> <br> sprouts, deli meats, hot dogs, smoked seafood, soft cheeses and raw unpasteurized milk.  <br> <br>Healthy people, if they`re exposed to listeria, they might get fever or diarrhea.  But people who are at high risk, they can get fever, muscle <br> <br> aches, headaches, a stiff neck, confusion and convulsions.<br> <br>Pregnant women who ate foods contaminated with listeria, they might get just a fever or maybe a fever and chills and headache.  But the big risk is <br> <br> that listeria can cause miscarriages.<br> <br>Listeria can kill.  The Centers for Disease Control estimates that about 260 people die each year after eating foods contaminated with listeria.  In <br> <br> addition, there are about 1,600 illnesses.<br> <br>Now, you can reduce your chances from getting sick with listeria.  So, first of all, rinse your produce, scrub firmed produce like melons and <br> <br> cucumbers with a brush, dry the produce, separate uncooked meats and poultry from other foods.<br> <br>Soft cheeses like Brie and Camembert and feta, those are very popular.  But look on the labels.  Make sure they are made with pasteurized milk.<br> <br>(END VIDEOTAPE)<br> <br>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>AZUZ (voice-over):  Ten-second trivia:<br> <br>What do elm, pine, and hickory trees all have in common?<br> <br>Are they all evergreen, deciduous, cone-bearing or pollen-producing?<br> <br>These trees are all pollen-producing and spring time is their season.<br> <br>(END VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>AZUZ:  So, if you`re allergic to pollen and you leave in the U.S., stock up on tissues.  Higher than normal pollen counts are forecast in the American <br> <br> East and peak levels are still to come.  If you`re allergic, experts recommend wearing sunglasses and hats to keep pollen out of your eyes and <br> <br> hair.  They say you should watch your hair before you go to sleep so that the pollen that`s in it doesn`t get on your pillow case.  Air filters can <br> <br> help, too.<br> <br>What`s to blame for this?<br> <br>Warm temperatures usually mean more pollen, unless it`s rainy, and in many places, winter seemed to take a break last month.<br> <br>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<br> <br>ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  If you suffer from allergies, this has not really been your season.  In 2017, allergy season actually started <br> <br> earlier than normal.  <br> <br>Now, we measure pollen by collecting all in a one cubic meter sample, within 24 hours, and that essentially gives you your pollen count.  <br> <br>Now, it hasn`t just been the pollen that`s been a big deal this year.  It`s also been the leaves on the trees.  Now, the dark green color that you see <br> <br> here is typically a 30-year average of when you`d start to see the leaves appear on the trees.  The light green color is this year.  Notice how much <br> <br> further north that line has been able to extend and that`s all been thanks to the incredibly warm temperatures we had in February.  <br> <br>However, as you recall, many areas had a big cold snap last week and that caused some problems for some of the famous trees, including the cherry <br> <br> blossoms.  Now, the National Cherry Blossoms Festival s taking place in Washington, D.C. starting this weekend.  Unfortunately, about a third of <br> <br> the total cherry blossoms were damaged due to that cold snap and will no longer bloom.  The good news is, there`s still two-thirds left, but the <br> <br> concern going forward is actually going to be the forecast, as we expect another cold snap to take place by the end of the week.<br> <br>(END VIDEOTAPE)<br> <br>AZUZ:  OK, what`s related to a camel, smaller than a llama and great for producing fleece?  <br> <br>Yes, we`re talking about alpaca.  This is the National Alpaca Show.  This year`s event just wrapped up in Colorado, where hundreds of alpaca farms <br> <br> helped provide people with everything from fleece to friendship.  The event, the competition, the chance to take a selfie with an alpaca, it`s <br> <br> all free.  <br> <br>One alpaca farmer says she hasn`t met anyone yet who doesn`t love alpacas.<br> <br>Now, whether you`re the type to say "alpaca one and take it home", or "alpaca my bags before taking one home", this shows a chance for you to <br> <br> live vicunarously to those who love their shear charm and are willing shear it with others, without fleecing them or pulling the wool over their eyes.  <br> <br>Llama let you go for the day, but we`ll be back tomorrow for shorn.  I`m Carl Azuz.<br> <br>END    <br> <br></p>

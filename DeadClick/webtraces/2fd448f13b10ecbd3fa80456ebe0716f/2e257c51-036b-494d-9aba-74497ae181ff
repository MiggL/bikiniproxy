            <p><em>Learn more about their  potential to lower risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, type 2  diabetes, and obesity.</em></p>
            <p>Despite the recommendations in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines  for Americans to consume more whole grains1 and the growing body of evidence  indicating that regular whole grain consumption could help protect against the  development of certain chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease,  metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cancer,2 consumers still may be  confused regarding what whole grains are, how they can improve health, and how  they can be incorporated into their diets.   </p>
            <p>This continuing education activity examines the health  benefits of eating whole grains and provides recommendations for RDs to suggest  to their clients and patients who want more whole grains in their diet.</p>
            <p><strong>Grains Defined</strong><br>
              Whole grains include the entire grain seed, called the  kernel, which consists of three components: bran, germ, and endosperm. If the  kernel has been cracked, crushed, or flaked, it must retain the same relative  proportions of these components to be called a whole grain.1 Examples of whole  grains are bulgur, oats, brown rice, buckwheat, corn, and quinoa.</p>
            <p>Refined grains have been processed (milled) to remove the  bran and germ to create a finer texture and improve shelf life, but this  process removes the dietary fiber, iron, and many B vitamins. To make enriched  refined grains, the B vitamins and iron are added back in.</p>
            <p><strong>Health Benefits</strong><br>
              Whole grains are rich sources of vitamins, minerals, dietary  fiber, lignans, beta-glucan, several phytochemicals, phytosterols, phytin, and  sphingolipids, all of which may have individual, synergistic, or additive  actions that positively affect health.3,4 In addition, whole grains’  phytochemicals complement the phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables when  they’re consumed together.3-5 </p>
            <p>Most of the beneficial phytochemicals in whole grains are  found in the bran and germ,5 the components that often are milled out during  refinement, resulting in grains composed mainly of the nutrient-poor endosperm.  Refined wheat flour loses 83% of total phenolic acids, 79% of total flavonoids,  93% of ferulic acid, 78% of total zeaxanthin, 51% of total lutein, and 42% of  total beta-crytoxanthin compared with whole wheat flour.5 </p>
            <p>Overall, studies show that consuming two to three servings  of whole grain foods per day will provide health benefits, possibly reducing  the risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, colon  cancer, and obesity.6 In prospective studies, the protection from these  diseases that results from consuming whole grains far exceeds the protection  expected from the individual nutrients and phytochemicals found in whole  grains.7 </p>
            <p><strong><em>Cardiovascular Disease</em></strong><br>
              More than one in three American adults have at least one  type of cardiovascular disease.8 The evidence for the protective benefit of  whole grains against cardiovascular disease is strong,2 and epidemiological  studies from North America and Europe consistently have shown that consuming  whole grains is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.9 For  example, both the Iowa Women’s Health Study10 and the Nurses’ Health Study11  found that as whole grain consumption increased, the risk of coronary heart  disease decreased. </p>
            <p>The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study observed that  consuming three servings of whole grain foods daily was associated with a 28%  lower risk of coronary artery disease12 and found a 7% lower risk of incident  heart failure per each additional whole grain serving.13 </p>
            <p>A recent systematic review of longitudinal studies  investigating whole grain intake in relation to cardiovascular disease found  that those who consumed 48 to 80 g of whole grains daily (three to five  servings) had a 21% lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared with  nonconsumers.14 And a recent meta-analysis of seven prospective studies  estimated a 21% lower risk of cardiovascular disease events among those who  consumed 2.5 servings of whole grains per day compared with those consuming  less than one-half of a serving daily.15 </p>
            <p><strong><em>Hypertension</em></strong><br>
              The possibility of developing hypertension, a major risk  factor for cardiovascular disease, also may be lower among those who consume  whole grains. In the Women’s Health Study, researchers found that women who  reported consuming at least four servings of whole grain foods daily had a 23%  reduced risk of developing hypertension compared with those who consumed less  than one-half of a serving per day.16 </p>
            <p>A recent intervention study found that among healthy  middle-aged adults, those who consumed three servings of whole grain foods per  day experienced reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that,  theoretically, translates to a 15% potential reduction in the risk of coronary  artery disease and a 25% reduction in the risk of stroke.17 </p>
            <p>Whole grains are an integral part of Dietary Approaches to  Stop Hypertension, a dietary pattern that the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for  Americans suggest following to control hypertension and achieve overall good  health.1,18 </p>
            <p><strong><em>Type 2 Diabetes</em></strong><br>
              Diabetes affects an estimated 25.8 million American adults,  and 90% to 95% of these people have type 2 diabetes. An additional 79 million  Americans have prediabetes, according to the National Diabetes Education  Program. </p>
            <p>Epidemiological studies indicate that people who consume  more whole grains have improved insulin resistance and a decreased risk of  developing type 2 diabetes, even after taking into account factors such as age,  calorie intake, and BMI.19,20 Studies also have found an association between  whole grain consumption and fasting glucose and insulin levels14,21-23 as well  as the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.   </p>
            <p>Further, a recent examination of 45 prospective studies and  21 randomized controlled trials found that individuals who consumed 48 to 80 g  of whole grains per day had a 26% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes  compared with those who seldom or never ate whole grains.14 </p>
            <p>Finnish researchers found that those who consumed the  greatest amount of whole grains had a 35% lower risk of developing type 2  diabetes compared with those who consumed the least.23 When researchers looked  at the data from the Nurses’ Health Studies I and II, they found that two  servings of whole grains per day were associated with a 21% decrease in the  risk of type 2 diabetes, even after adjusting for factors such as BMI.24 </p>
            <p><strong><em>Colon Cancer</em></strong><br>
              According to the American Cancer Society, in the United  States, colon cancer is the third most common type of cancer in both men and  women. Several epidemiological studies conducted in the United States and  internationally have found a significant reduction in the risk of colorectal  cancer among people who consume the greatest amount of whole grains.25-27</p>
            <p>A survey of more than 61,000 women in Sweden found a 24%  lower risk of colorectal cancer in those who consumed the most whole grains (hard  whole grain rye bread, soft whole grain bread, porridge, and cold breakfast  cereals) compared with those who consumed the least.25 Similarly, the NIH-AARP  Diet and Health Study found a 20% reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer  among those who consumed the greatest amount of whole grains compared with  those who consumed the least.26 </p>
            <p>A 2011 meta-analysis of prospective studies published in <strong><em>BMJ</em></strong> confirmed that a high intake of whole grains was associated with a reduced risk  of colorectal cancer.27 Specifically, it found that there was a 20% reduction  in the risk of colorectal cancer for every three servings of whole grains  consumed per day, and the risk was even lower with higher intakes.27 </p>
            <p>Several   whole grain components can have a positive effect on gastrointestinal health,   including fiber, oligosaccharides, phytochemicals, antioxidant vitamins, and   minerals, though fiber has been studied most extensively. These components may   act together to protect against cancer and inflammation while strengthening   barrier function and providing immune support.2</p>
            <p>Different types of whole grains are likely to have different  effects on bowel health. In a randomized, crossover study in which men were fed  rye and wheat foods and researchers analyzed biomarkers of bowel health, such  as levels of butyrate and enterolactone (higher levels of both are associated  with improved bowel health), rye was more effective than wheat in the overall  improvement of the biomarkers.28 </p>
            <p><strong><em>Obesity</em></strong><br>
              According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  almost one-third of adults and one in five children and adolescents between the  ages of 6 and 19 are obese,29   increasing their risk of numerous health conditions, including  hypertension, adverse lipid concentrations, and type 2 diabetes. </p>
            <p>Both cross-sectional and prospective epidemiological studies  suggest that including whole grains in the diet reduces the risk of obesity and  weight gain, though the effects are modest.30 In one study of men, it was  estimated that for every 40-g increase (2.5 servings) in their daily  consumption of whole grains, weight gain over an eight-year period was reduced  by 2.4 lbs.31 A systematic review of studies also found a modest reduction in  BMI and waist circumference in people who consumed three servings of whole  grains daily.32 </p>
            <p>However, not all studies have found a connection between  reduced obesity risk and whole grain consumption. A recent unpublished review  presented at the 2012 Whole Grains Summit that analyzed 25 controlled trials of  whole grains vs. non-whole grains showed inconsistent results that didn’t  support the findings in prospective studies. </p>
            <p>A study published in the <strong><em>Journal of Nutrition</em></strong> in  2012 investigated the effects of whole grain vs. refined wheat consumption on  body weight and composition in women who were overweight or obese. After a  two-week run-in period during which they consumed refined wheat foods, the  participants were followed for 12 weeks while consuming either whole grain or  refined wheat. Consumption of whole grain products resulted in a greater  reduction in the percentage of body fat, although body weights didn’t change.33 </p>
            <p>The researchers suggested the fat loss could have been  attributed to lower postprandial insulin and glucose responses that favor  lipolysis and lipid oxidation rather than fat storage. The lack of difference  in weight loss between the groups, the researchers proposed, was likely the  result of a smaller effect of the whole grains than anticipated as well as a  larger variation in weight loss than predicted in the group.</p>
            <p>If consuming whole grains helps lower body weight and/or  body fat, several mechanisms may be involved, including lower energy density of  whole grain products, lower glycemic index, satiety, and modulating levels and  types of bacteria in the intestinal tract.34 </p>
            <p><strong>Possible Mechanisms  of Disease Prevention</strong><br>
              Because whole grains are complex mixtures of nutrients and  phytochemicals, which may work together to prevent chronic disease, no single  nutrient, phytochemical, or specific combination has been identified as being  responsible for their health benefits. Among the many possible mechanisms by  which whole grains may prevent disease are the following:</p>
            <p>• prebiotic effect of whole grains resulting in alterations  in the gut microflora;</p>
            <p>• pH changes in the colon;</p>
            <p>• bioactive compounds found in whole grains that have  disease prevention effects;</p>
            <p>• polyphenols that may be involved in cell signaling and  gene regulation; </p>
            <p>• compounds that contribute to the low-glycemic-index  property of whole grain foods; and</p>
            <p>• food structure that reduces transit time.</p>
            <p><strong>Future Research</strong><br>
              While the majority of population studies show a positive  association between whole grain consumption and a reduced risk of several  chronic diseases, relatively few intervention studies have been done, and not  all of them have shown the same positive results. Ideally, long-term  intervention trials would be performed, but that may be unrealistic because of  the long-term nature of the development of chronic diseases and the resulting  costs of conducting such studies.</p>
            <p><strong>Whole Grain Recommendations</strong><br>
              Despite inconsistencies in research findings regarding whole  grains, health organizations, nutrition experts, and the federal government  recommend that everyone increase their consumption of whole grains. The 2010  Dietary Guidelines for Americans urge everyone to make at least one-half of the  grains in their diet whole grains. </p>
            <p>Make clients and patients aware that grain foods labeled  “multigrain,” “wheat bread,” “bran,” “wheat germ,” “unbleached wheat flour,”  “100% wheat,” or “organic flour” do not guarantee a whole grain product. The  two easiest ways for clients and patients to know they’re getting whole grains  is to look for products that list whole grain first on the ingredient list,  though even that may not be an accurate indicator of foods that contain several  grains, or to look for the Whole Grain Stamp created by the Whole Grains  Council, which is a nonprofit consumer education organization. </p>
            <p>There are two Whole Grain Stamps, the basic stamp and the  100% whole grain stamp, which are designed to clearly mark those products that  contain either at least 8 g of whole grains per serving but may contain refined  grains (the basic stamp) or at least 16 g of whole grains per serving and all  of its grain ingredients are whole grain (the 100% whole grain stamp). The  recommended number of grams per serving is 16 g, and the recommended number of  whole grain grams per day is 48 g.</p>
            <p>Education about convenient ways to increase whole grain  intake, without making drastic changes in patients’ or clients’ eating habits  is key. Suggest they do some or all of the following:</p>
            <p>• Have instant oatmeal at breakfast, adding their own fruit  or sweetener to maintain the healthfulness.</p>
            <p>• Enjoy popcorn as a snack but without dousing it in butter.</p>
            <p>• Serve corn on the cob or canned corn as a side dish.</p>
            <p>• Mix their usual refined breakfast cereal with a whole  grain cereal, gradually increasing the amount of whole grain cereal.</p>
            <p>• Choose whole grain bread, rolls, buns, pitas, or tortillas  for sandwiches, hamburgers, hot dogs, wraps, and tacos.</p>
            <p>• Choose whole grain crackers for snacking.</p>
            <p>• Add barley or brown rice to canned soups and stews.</p>
            <p>• Serve wild rice as a side dish.</p>
            <p>• Substitute one-half of the white flour with whole wheat  flour when they bake cookies, muffins, and pancakes.</p>
            <p>• Add 1/2 cup of cooked bulgur, wild rice, or barley to  bread stuffing.</p>
            <p>• Buy whole grain pasta.</p>
            <p><strong>Barriers to Whole  Grain Consumption</strong><br>
              An analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey, published in the <strong><em>Journal of the American Dietetic Association</em></strong>,  found that, despite the push in the Dietary Guidelines to consume at least  three servings of whole grains daily, Americans consume, on average, less than  one serving per day.35 Fewer than 5% of adults consume the amount recommended,  while fewer than 30% of adolescents consume more than 8 g of whole grains per  day.36 </p>
            <p>The 2011 Nutrition and You Trends Survey, conducted by the  Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, determined that in the last five years, 45%  of those surveyed said their consumption of whole grains had remained the same;  48% said it had increased; and 7% said it actually had decreased during that  time, yet 71% reported that they consume enough whole grains.  </p>
            <p>When the International Food Information Council asked consumers  which of the Dietary Guidelines they were interested in acting on, only 37%  cited “increasing whole grain consumption,” highlighting the disconnect between  recommendations and motivation to take action.  </p>
            <p>Among the barriers—some real and some perceived—to  increasing whole grain consumption are taste (dryness and bitterness), texture  (more firm), difficulty in obtaining whole grains when eating out, cost, and  time constraints when preparing whole grains at home.37 Dietitians can  introduce clients and patients to products that contain smaller amounts of  whole grains, which are familiar in taste and texture to refined grains yet  still contribute to their intake of whole grains. RDs should recommend whole  grain products, such as instant oatmeal, quinoa, whole grain couscous, and  quick-cooking brown rice, which require minimal cooking time. In addition, they  can help clients identify restaurants and fast-food venues that offer whole  grain options.</p>
            <p><strong>Strongest Research</strong><br>
              The evidence for the health benefits of consuming whole  grains appears strongest for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.  Studies also suggest a connection between the consumption of whole grains and a  reduced risk of colon cancer and type 2 diabetes. The evidence is less  convincing for the prevention of obesity. </p>
            <p>While the findings of population studies are strong and  convincing, results of clinical intervention trials have been inconsistent to  date. However, enough evidence exists to suggest that RDs should advise their  patients to consume three servings of whole grains (48 g) per day.

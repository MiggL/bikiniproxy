My biggest issue is that the sleeves are too short. When I sit down they rise to almost three quarter sleeves and a lot of my wrist is exposed, so this isn\'t a good thing when trying to keep warm during these cold months...an added extra two inches would be best. On to the shedding...this fleece sheds fuzzies like crazy. I have run it through the washer and dryer twice now. Overall I love the fleece, but there are these couple things that definitely make it a little less likely I will purchase another.",g:[{n:"Fit",k:"fit",v:["Feels true to size"]},{n:"Sleeve Length",k:"sleevelength",v:["Feels too short"]}]}},{r:{id:318000350,si:1,v:0,t:0,r:3,h:"Great Purchase",n:"Charlotte",l:"en_US",w:"Pennsylvania",b:{n:"Bottom Line",k:"Yes"},o:"w",d:"1\/29\/2018",db:"2018-01-29T05:01:19",p:"This past Christmas, I purchased three of these jackets.

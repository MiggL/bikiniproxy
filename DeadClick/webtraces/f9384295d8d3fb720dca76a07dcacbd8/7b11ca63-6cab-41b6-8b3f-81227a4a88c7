            Established and presided by Reg Clark for 20 years, followed by Lee Pledger for an additional 25, the club's purpose was to facilitate an exchange of information among its North American members.<br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

            In these modern, Internet days, the club is run by Capt. Ranko Zunic, President and Ian Turner, Editor and has the broader mandate of being an international club that can also provide its members with the ability to easily book freighter voyages.</td>

Operating from Vancouver, BC to Hamburg and Bremen there are many ports of call enroute so that the full trip takes approximately 42 days at a cost of only $500 or $12 per day. At these rates you cannot afford to stay home.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

            Embarkation ports are Vancouver, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and you may book passage to Antwerp, Amsterdam, Rotterdam or first German port. From California the fare is $460.00.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

            Both fares quoted are for accommodations in two berth cabins with private shower and toilet.  Deck space is ample and public rooms include a smoking room and bar. Excellent German food is served. Sailings about every three weeks. <br><br></td>

Of course he can take his car with him, however most people prefer to rent a car in Europe or buy one there on a guaranteed re-purchase plan.  There are a number of reasons why we think it better not to take your car, not the least of which is the expense.  From the Pacific Coast to Europe and return it will cost from $800 to $1,000.  In addition gasoline costs in Europe are high and the smaller European cars will save many, many dollars in fuel costs alone.  Further, with the exception of a few magnificent highways like the Autobahn in Germany, European roads are narrow and winding and American cars are simply too long and too wide for comfortable driving.</td>

            If you are in good health you should certainly take your trip.  If you have a history of any serious disease, or if you think you might need medical attention, don’t take a freighter, take a passenger ship.  There are some lines that will not take passengers over 70 and almost all require a medical certification of good health if you are over 65.  This certification should be a letter from your own doctor on his letterhead.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

            Freighters, including containerships and general cargo ships, are one of the lifelines of the world economy, but of the oceangoing ships in the world, only about 1% carry both passengers and cargo. It's a special niche serving those travelers with the time and temperament to sail long itineraries - anywhere from a few weeks to several months - and who don't mind doing without the amenities of a modern cruise ship.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

            Most of these ships are French and some German, all with international officers and crew onboard, offering accommodations for 2 to 12 passengers on roundtrip voyages, as well as longer one way voyages (between the continents only).</td>

          <td><span style="font-weight: bold; ">2) How large are freighters, and what cargo do they carry ...? </span><br>

              <br>

            Ocean going general cargo ships used to be between 3,000 and 15,000 tons.  Today they are more likely to be 20,000 to 40,000 tons, while containerships are 20,000 to 200,000 tons or, expressed in container capacity, from 2,000 to over 20,000 TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Units).<br>
<br>
Cargo ranges from A for automotive parts to Z for zucchini. In other words large engine parts, the furnishings of an entire home or temperature-sensitive chilled produce, all is carried nowadays under optimum logistical conditions to ensure that cargo reaches its destination safely and on schedule.<br>

            <span style="font-weight: bold; ">3) ... What flags do they fly ...?</span><br>

            <br>

            The majority of them fly <i>flags of convenience</i>, which is why in most cases the flag is not included in our data, but rather the nationality of the owners or managers, senior officers and crew members.  While passenger service is usually offered by the shipowner, we also indicate if the ship is running its main cargo operation for someone else (charterer).

            <br>

            In addition to the care and control of its owners and flag state, every ship is supervised during its construction, as well as checked and tested for its seaworthiness throughout its life by one of the classification societies such as Lloyd Register (LR), American Bureau of Shipping (AB), Germanisher Lloyd (GL), Bureau Veritas (BV) or Norske Veritas (NV). Society initials appear on the hull of the ship as a part of the Plimsoll mark. The Plimsoll mark indicates the depth to which the ship can be safely loaded during various seasons and in various locales. And port authorities on every voyage ensure the ship's compliance with respect to the security of both passengers and cargo.<br />

            On the subject of pirates, as has always been through the ages, there is still such activity in a few areas of the world. They generally do not affect larger and faster ships. The small expedition ships and mail and coastal ships which we feature on our pages are outside these areas. The International Maritime Organization, the United Nations’ specialized agency responsible for improving maritime safety, monitors, investigates and reports on piracy at www.imo.org.

We discuss what we want from the port visits and how we will do them.  Often we share a cab into town and then we separate.

They are more spacious than cabins on the average cruise ship.  Some provide amenities such as a mini refrigerator, TV/DVD and stereo sets, and in house/ship telephone.  Front- and aft-facing cabins, may have their views obstructed by the containers stowed on deck.<br>

            Mealtimes offer an invaluable opportunity to speak with the captain and officers and listen to their maritime stories and anecdotes in an informal and relaxed atmosphere. The English spoken, as well as the food served, is colored by their nationality, which is one of the attractions of traveling by freighter. The meals, prepared fresh and served three times a day, are included in the cruise price, with complimentary wine being offered with lunch and dinner on some ships. The pantry is usually open to anyone fancying a light snack. On freighters one cannot expect food to satisfy any special dietary needs, but most chefs will prepare something else when the menu of the day is not to someone’s liking.<br>

            Serendipity played an important part in making our dining experience more enjoyable.  When we first boarded, meals were adequate but completely uninspired and boring.

            <br>

            Cabin service is available on a daily or weekly basis, depending on the ship.  Linen is usually changed weekly, but will be done more frequently if requested.  Meals are served in the dining room only at set times and seatings may be prearranged.  The dining room is usually smoke free, while the TV/Bar lounge is not.  Basic toiletries and popular beverages and cigarettes may be obtained at duty free prices from a small onboard shop.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            “The ship has a limited amount of items for sale including toilet soap and washing powder for the laundry and, best of all, liquid refreshments - all at duty-free prices!”<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Self-service bar accounts can be settled once a week or once a month, with cash in US Dollars or Euro. Self-service laundry facilities are available.  Mail needs to be either stamped or paid for, and delivered to a designated officer/purser.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            “An important thing to keep in mind is that this is a working ship.  The officers and crew were always very friendly and polite to us, but they were hired to run the ship, not to entertain passengers or act as tour guides”.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            “The crew at all levels are gentlemen. In passing, they greet you in some manner, a smile, a wave, or a ‘Morning’. Still, they are professionals with a job to do that does not include entertaining or teaching passengers.  This is not to say that they do not engage in conversation but it tends to be on their terms.”<br>

Officers are offten European, and use their mother tongue among themselves, while crewmembers are usually Filipino, and they speak Tagalog.  But when speaking to each other, or to the passengers, they all speak English.  Some are fluent, others are not, but they all can answer any questions you may have.<br>

            Tipping is at the passenger's discretion and is limited to the cabin and dining room stewards, often one and the same person, who shares it with the chef.  A good guideline is to allow for USD 3.00 - 5.00 a day per person traveling.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            “We took a cabin close to the dining room, two decks apart, which meant that we had to climb four flights of stairs for every meal.  At first it was daunting, but after a few days it became routine, and the improvement in the shape of my thighs by the end of the trip was worth it all!  On an average day I climbed up and down between the bridge and dinning room thirty flights of stairs.”<br>

          <td>“As for wardrobe, take one 'very nice outfit' to wear ashore and put it in your closet immediately.  Then wear all your oldest clothes.  We quickly found out that we were on a working ship where the men are constantly washing, scraping, painting, and greasing cables.  Unless we were willing to remain in our air-conditioned cabin, we had to cope with all this activity including smudges of whatever was being used on the ship, as well as occasional soot deposits from the smoke stack.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

            The crew always washed the ship the day after leaving any port, but while it was being loaded and unloaded there was no way to avoid some dirt.  We wore boat shoes constantly since the decks are frequently wet and slippery, darker color T-shirts and cotton pants for most of the trip, and were able to donate a bundle of cleaning rags to the oilers in the engine room when we departed.  That left us plenty of luggage room for the great souvenirs we picked up all over the world.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

            The 'very nice outfit' for going ashore included pants and shirt in a lightweight silk.  After a day in the hot sun you can walk into the shower carrying your silks with you, wash everything, hang them on a plastic hanger, and they're ready to wear the next day.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

            We also brought several soft hats that either sat down well on the head or were tied on in some way as a ship running at 20 knots per hour creates its own wind.  A few heavy sweaters and two pairs of lightweight wool pants took care of the cooler weather.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

            As no hairdresser was available for over three months, I took headbands and combs and let my hair grow, which took away the temptation to hack at it myself.”<br>

17) Why is the fare quoted in foreign currency?</span><br>

            <br>

            Steamship lines publish their tariffs and collect payments in their national currencies, usually Euro (EUR). Maris offers you a choice to pay in EUR currency or in US/Canadian Dollars at the prevailing exchange rate, by a bank transfer or check (credit card payments are not accepted).<br>

<br />
 <span style="font-weight: bold; ">18) Do I have to pay extra if the voyage takes longer?</span><br>

            <br>

            Voyages can sometimes be longer or shorter than anticipated, however there will be no extra charge for an extended period or refund for a shorter one, unless otherwise stipulated.<br />

 <span style="font-weight: bold; ">
19) How much luggage is allowed?</span><br>

            <br>

            Approx. two suitcases per person, depending on the steamship line. But maximum 1 cubic meter, or 100 kilograms. For anything more than that, please see the following question and answer.<br>

 <span style="font-weight: bold; ">
20) Can I bring my car and other personal belongings with me?</span><br>
<br>
We can only book passengers. Anything beyond allowed luggage (Q&A 19) is handled by freight forwarders. They might send your bike/s in a consolidated container (packed together with other motor bikes and small cars) on any ship or steamship line. You pick it up from a terminal or warehouse on arrival at your destination. They have their own tariffs, and that cost has nothing to do with your passenger fare.<br>
<br>
Freighters are in the business of carrying freight, so the freight forwarder might be able to get your car on the same vessel you are traveling on, but you may end up paying a higher rate.  Keep in mind that not all freighters offer passenger service, so you should plan to make your own reservations first.</td>

 <span style="font-weight: bold; ">
23) What are the visa, medical and insurance requirements?</span><br>

            <br>

            Passports must be valid at least six months beyond the anticipated return date, and foreign visas must be obtained in advance.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Vaccination against yellow fever is often required.  This varies from time to time and for different parts of the world.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Regardless of age, all passengers must ensure that they are fully fit to travel and have no serious medical condition.  A medical questionnaire must be completed and duly signed by both your physician and yourself confirming that you are able to travel on a freighter where there is not a doctor on board.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            While International Health and Accident Insurance is mandatory, and its main details with benefits and claims telephone number must be provided, Trip Cancellation and Interruption Insurance is not required but is highly recommended to protect your investment against cancellation fees. Travelex Insurance packages, covering you from the moment you buy the policy, are available to all Maris customers, worldwide, on our website page <a href="http://www.freightercruises.com/before_sail.php" target="_blank">Before You Sail</a>. And if you buy the Travelex policy within three weeks of your initial trip deposit, pre-existing conditions are waived.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            All required documents must be provided latest three weeks, exceptionally for short notice bookings two weeks, before departure.<br>

24) What services are available in port?</span><br>

            <br>

            While the Captain, officers and port agents may be able to offer some advice about shore visits, one cannot count on this.  It's best to prepare yourself in advance and be well-informed about your ports of call and what you want to see.<br>

            <br>

            “When we arrived at a port there was no tour bus carrying thirty passengers, or a lady holding her umbrella in the air to show you the sights or guide you to souvenir shops. From the moment we walked down the gangplank, we were on our own. So again, it's a question of whether you like to be led or you like to explore on your own”.</td>

25) How long do the ships stay in port ...?</span><br>

              <br>

            The average port time is one day, longer for general cargo ships, less for mail ships and smaller containerships. Variations in published shedules often happen due to weather conditions, port congestion, cargo delivery, etc. <br>

26) ... and how far from the town do they dock?</span><br>

            <br>

            Vessels dock at terminals which are often situated outside the center of a town or city, so passengers usually have to take a taxi in.  Photo below shows Papeete, Tahiti with freighters at their berths in the background.<br>

27) How do I know when the ship will arrive and where to board the vessel?</span><br>

            <br>
            Port agent contact information is included with your ticket, which is delivered via email a few weeks before departure. Although ships are late sometimes for a day or two, but also, less likely, can arrive early, for this reason and to have some latitude in the case of your own traveling difficulties, plan to travel to or near the embarkation port a day or two ahead of time. When port agent gets in touch with the ship captain, he will instruct you where the port or terminal gate is and when to be there. Transportation within the terminal (gate to ship) is usually allowed only to authorized vehicles, which may charge for the service (cash on the spot), especially in the US ports.<br>

<br />
 <span style="font-weight: bold; ">28) When and how do I make my reservation?</span><br>

            <br>

            Freighter voyages can be booked anytime, from several weeks to a year or more ahead. Travelers who wish to take a particular ship, cabin and time of the year, should make reservations well in advance, or in other words - when you know what you want.<br />
<br />    
To help us make your trip planning and reservation procedures a pleasant experience, please familiarize yourself with this type of travel by reviewing the information on the ship, voyage, <A HREF="https://www.freightercruises.com/general_info.php" target="_blank">General Info.</A> and documents required. Then please apply through our office by giving us as wide a period for your departure as you can, e.g. earliest November 10 - latest December 20, preferably around beginning of December. In consultation with the steamship line/s, we'll offer you the best option/s available. A deposit for 25% of the fare is required to secure the reservation. The balance of the fare is payable 7-10 weeks before departure.<br />
<br />   
<u>Please remember</u>: knowing and respecting the fact that freighter schedules can vary will help put your mind at ease and enable you to better enjoy your voyage and preparations. Ports of embarkation and disembarkation, as well as the vessel and itinerary, may change for a variety of reasons including cargo requirements, holidays, weather conditions, port congestion or other factors beyond the carrier’s control. This may affect your pre- and post-freighter voyage travel arrangements. The steamship line, or its agents, are unable to make those arrangements for you.<br />

29) Comments made by the following authors contributed in this Q. &amp; A. Guide:</span><br />

            <br />

 Bill MacRobbie, Carl I. Swanson, Vivienne Knapp and Bob Hartley. Mr. Hartley’s were taken from his book.<br>

            </div>

            <br />

            <br />
At the end of Mr. Hartley's book, we found the following few lines of advice:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“· If you are taking a trip of any length buy a map and hang it on the wall.  Looking at the overall route was helpful and prompted many discussions with crew and fellow passengers.  Bring double-sided tape for hanging your map as well as for a million other uses.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

            · When I was writing, I left my cabin door open.  Many of the tidbits of information in this book came through that open door.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       

            · I had little success with a short wave radio and frankly, after a few days at sea I lost interest in ‘worldly’ affairs.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

            · Bring your digital camera.  Better still, also bring a small printer.  Photos of activities onboard are much appreciated.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       

            · If possible, have the ship’s stamp put in your passport.  At some ports they gave us a shore pass.  Where they didn’t, it was helpful when returning from town to have proof that I was a passenger on the freighter.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            · When returning from shore leave, bring back a candy bar for the crew member greeting you at the gangplank.”<br>

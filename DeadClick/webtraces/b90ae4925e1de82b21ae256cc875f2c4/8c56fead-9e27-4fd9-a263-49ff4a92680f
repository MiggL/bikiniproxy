After what had happened, I knew I should make more effort to spend time with my 74-year-old dad, but what I was proposing at his age was a risk. A 10-day hike around one of Europe\u0026rsquo;s highest mountains seemed a little extreme.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Old age doesn\u0026rsquo;t come alone,\u0026rdquo; he replied, implying the aches and pains, arthritic hands and memory loss from a recent life-threatening stroke couldn\u0026rsquo;t be ignored.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at me with a fatherly look, suggesting he knew better. I wondered if he could make it. In his youth, unquestionably; but now I wasn\u0026rsquo;t so sure. Perhaps a trip hiking Mont Blanc\u0026rsquo;s steep-faced valleys, following a hut-to-hut trail through France, Italy and Switzerland, was already past him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xnkjf\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou may also be interested in:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180118-dalmatias-fjaka-state-of-mind\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhere doing nothing is a way of life\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20171015-why-norway-is-teaching-travellers-to-travel\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe code that travellers need to learn\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20170924-the-town-that-sold-mountains-to-the-world\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eA town that sold mountains to the world\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow a grandfather, he had spent his best years in the Alps \u0026ndash; summer after summer, in fact \u0026ndash; and to take him along this pathway in search of a route to his past, to stir memory in long-forgotten footprints, seemed like the right thing to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll remember the mountain refuges are beautiful,\u0026rdquo; I said casually, compelled to disturb what lay hidden in his memory. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s half the reason for going.\u0026rdquo; It was shrewd of me to work in the idea of fondue, red wine and good company; we booked a flight, and four months later, arrived in the shadow of Mont Blanc (4,807m) in Chamonix, France.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Tour du Mont Blanc is a challenge for anyone, regardless of age, condition or state of mind. A bucket-list pilgrimage for long-distance hikers, it is a 170km, high-altitude journey on foot, a ritual walk through great landscapes and drama that plugs hikers in to something unquantifiable, yet life-affirming. While I travelled for a love of people, food, drink and culture, my father had always been drawn to places that weren\u0026rsquo;t as easily accessible. The mountains appealed because of their unreachability. Hikers, he once told me, came to learn about themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xnljz\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat first sunlit afternoon, it was instantly obvious we\u0026rsquo;d made the right decision. The pathway ahead was quiet, little more than a few bell-clanging cows, a couple of errant dogs, a rosy-cheeked French farmer en route to his summer cottage. Hedgerows and thickets of wild Alpenrose lined the trail\u0026rsquo;s edges. On the horizon, stone-faced peaks sat above the plateau, skirted by pine forests and chequerboard fields. Quick-footed hikers trotted past us, eyes focused on a ridge that marched south to the Italian border. But there was no sign of worry etched on my hiking partner\u0026rsquo;s brow. Only determination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy dad\u0026rsquo;s hazy accounts of his time in the mountains remain among the defining stories of my childhood. The first time it left an indelible mark was when flicking through a junk box full of projector slides taken circa summer 1970, when he and two friends completed a previously untried route up the notoriously dangerous North Face of the Eiger (3,970m) in Switzerland\u0026rsquo;s Bernese Oberland. At the time, he was 27 and to scale the final 1,829m North Pillar wall on the way to the summit was unthinkable. The extreme highs and lows were not easy for him to recount. Along the way, he suffered frostbite, dealt with unexpectedly bad weather and bivouacked night after night in sodden climbing gear on treacherous, ice-coated vertical slabs. Afterwards, he was quoted by The Herald newspaper, the expedition\u0026rsquo;s sponsor, saying: \u0026ldquo;I'll never set foot on that bloody mountain again in my life.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e What I\u0026rsquo;d always seen as an unhealthy obsession with the mountains revealed itself to be a bond I never knew we had \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill today, it\u0026rsquo;s almost inconceivable for me to comprehend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn those days, there were other equally spellbinding tales, most of which took him to the Chamonix valley. He summited the Grandes Jorasses (4,208m) in blinding sunshine. He scaled the ice walls of the Aiguille du Chardonnet (3,824m). Hell, on one occasion, he even posed atop the remarkable Aiguille du Gr\u0026eacute;pon (3,482m), a fist of angular rock crafted like a church spire \u0026ndash; an exploit that would test the mettle of even the most carefree climber. To an eight-year-old boy, these were unforgettable adventures, shaping my travel perceptions in years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat was now more than half his lifetime ago. And, yet, here we were, marching side by side around the Mont Blanc massif, tracing an invisible route with our fingers over the same harsh and elemental summits he\u0026rsquo;d conquered long ago. What I\u0026rsquo;d always seen as an unhealthy obsession with the mountains revealed itself to be a bond I never knew we had.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xnk54\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs day one drifted into days two and three, we crossed from France into Italy, over the Col de la Seigne, a crested hilltop long an ancient gateway for shepherds to the Aosta Valley. The southern aspect of Mont Blanc and its fraternity of Italian-set buttresses and peaks \u0026ndash; Punta Baretti, Picco Luigi Amedeo, the Grand Pilier d\u0026rsquo;Angle \u0026ndash; were spectacular, and had him reminiscing over a glass of wine in the resort of Courmayeur on our third night. Never one with words, he was hard-pushed to explain why these landscapes meant so much to him. Words failed and he shook his head as if to free a lost memory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe days passed and began to take on a predictable rhythm, the path carrying us ever forward. We rose late, left later (stalled by having to medicate my dad with a daily dose of pills), stopped for lunch then enjoyed a beer on the back of a farmer\u0026rsquo;s wagon. Finally, after some 20km of up and downhill slog, we\u0026rsquo;d reach our stop for the night, long after everyone else, but just before stillness descended upon the valley.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Wait for your old man,\u0026rdquo; he\u0026rsquo;d sigh, struggling to catch his breath. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll get there eventually.\u0026rdquo; And yet this ticking time bomb soldiered on. The base-camp beard and summit gleam from the 1960s had disappeared, but the smile stayed put.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xnkxv\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy week\u0026rsquo;s end, now back in France after more than 150km through the Swiss farmstead villages of La Fouly and Champex, I sensed we may have achieved what we both had thought impossible. We made our final push towards the Col du Brevent above the Chamonix valley, side-stepping along a devilishly narrow path, then tackled a series of unforeseen rudimentary ladders bolted into the rock, my dad enthusiastically swearing with every rung. It was an apt final hurdle. We climbed up into a narrow world of stone, light and echo, meeting Mont Blanc face on. An ailing Scottish grandpa in good company with the grandfather of the Alps.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo capture the moment, I took a family portrait, but only then did it dawn on me it was nearly the same composition as on a slide I\u0026rsquo;d first seen in one of those junk boxes, taken almost 50 years ago. There was that smile, those eyes fixed on the horizon, the beautiful Alpine ridges of Mont Blanc crowding out the background. For a split second, it looked like nothing had changed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCTravel/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFacebook\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, or follow us on\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Travel\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTwitter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbc_travel/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eInstagram\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you liked this story,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=ear.bbc.email.we.email-signup\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003esign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

When he reached a clearing, he rummaged through his bag and then slowly climbed a 3m-tall wooden ladder to deliver a purple envelope to a 500-year-old oak tree.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Just one today,\u0026rdquo; he told me, before crunching back through the forest and disappearing towards the next letterbox on his route.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe purple envelope was from Denies in Bavaria. She\u0026rsquo;s 55, isn\u0026rsquo;t afraid to laugh at herself and loves nature. She knows what she wants, doesn\u0026rsquo;t mind being alone but wonders if there\u0026rsquo;s a man out there who can surprise her.

In his two decades of service to the oak, Martens delivered letters from six continents, often in languages he didn\u0026rsquo;t understand. He explained that while today many people know about the tree, 128 years ago it was a secret shared by two lovers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1890, a local girl named Minna fell in love with a young chocolate maker named Wilhelm. Minna\u0026rsquo;s father forbade her from seeing Wilhelm, so the two started secretly exchanging handwritten letters by leaving them in a knothole in the oak\u0026rsquo;s trunk. A year later, Minna\u0026rsquo;s father finally granted her permission to marry Wilhelm, and the two were wed on 2 June 1891 under the oak tree\u0026rsquo;s branches.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe story of the couple\u0026rsquo;s fairy-tale courtship spread, and soon, hopeful romantics throughout Germany who had no luck finding partners in biergartens or ballrooms began writing love letters to the Bridegroom\u0026rsquo;s Oak. The tree received so much mail that, in 1927, the German postal service, Deutsche Post, assigned the oak its own postcode and postman. It also placed a ladder up to the fist-sized postbox, so that anyone who wanted to open, read and respond to the letters could.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe only rule, Martens explained, is that if you open a letter you don\u0026rsquo;t want to answer, you should place it back in the tree for someone else to find.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xxs77\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The tree receives about 1,000 letters a year,\u0026rdquo; said Martin Grundler, spokesman for Deutsche Post. \u0026ldquo;Most come in the summertime. I suppose that\u0026rsquo;s when everyone wants to fall in love.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor those sweet on someone specific, there\u0026rsquo;s a legend that says if a woman walks around the oak\u0026rsquo;s trunk three times under a full moon while thinking of her beloved, without speaking or laughing, she\u0026rsquo;ll marry within the year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday the Bridegroom\u0026rsquo;s Oak remains the only tree in the world with its own mailing address. Six days a week for the past 91 years, a postman has walked through the forest \u0026ndash; rain, snow or shine \u0026ndash; and climbed the ladder to stuff letters from starry-eyed singles into the tree. And no-one has ever delivered mail to the oak tree longer than Martens.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e The tree receives about 1,000 letters a year \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It was my favourite part of the day,\u0026rdquo; Martens said, handing me a black-and-white photo of him wearing a brimmed cap and bifocals, smiling as he dropped letters into the oak. \u0026ldquo;People used to memorise my route and wait for me to arrive because they couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe that a postman would deliver letters to a tree.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 20 years, Martens said there were only 10 days when no-one wrote to the oak, and while he\u0026rsquo;d occasionally deliver as many as 50 envelopes a day, not all of them were love letters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Before unification [in 1990], people from East Germany who had no contacts in the West used to write to the tree and ask what kind of cars and music we had available,\u0026rdquo; Martens remembered. \u0026ldquo;I wanted to write back, but my boss recommended me not to.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to Martens, other messages that arrived over the years started as sweet nothings and blossomed into beautiful somethings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xxs32\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1958, a young German soldier named Peter Pump reached into the oak, felt several letters and pulled out a piece of paper that had just a name and address on it. On a whim, he decided to respond to the \u0026lsquo;Honoured Miss Marita\u0026rsquo;, who hadn\u0026rsquo;t written to the tree in the first place \u0026ndash; her friends had, knowing she was too timid. Peter and Marita corresponded for a full year before he built up the courage to meet her. They were married in 1961 and are celebrating their 57th wedding anniversary this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there\u0026rsquo;s the story of the Christiansens. In 1988, Martens delivered a letter to the oak from a 19-year-old East German girl named Claudia, who was looking for a pen pal. A West German farmer named Friedrich Christiansen found it and wrote back to her. One letter turned into 40, and the couple fell in love. Unable to meet, Friedrich and Claudia exchanged letters for nearly two years across the border. When the Wall fell, the two met for the first time and were married in May 1990.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I know of at least 10 marriages brought together by the tree,\u0026rdquo; Martens said. \u0026ldquo;One, in particular, sticks out.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e I know of at least 10 marriages brought together by the tree \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1989, a German TV station was doing a special feature on the oak, and asked Martens if he himself had ever found love under its branches. He said he hadn\u0026rsquo;t. A few days later, while Martens was climbing up the ladder to deliver the mail to the Bridegroom, he spotted a handwritten note from a woman named Renate addressed to the oak\u0026rsquo;s postman.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I would like to meet you,\u0026rdquo; it read. \u0026ldquo;You are my type. At the moment, I am also alone.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;So I called her \u0026ndash; rather clumsily \u0026ndash; and soon I met her,\u0026rdquo; Martens said, handing me a picture of he and Renate kissing on their wedding day. \u0026ldquo;We were married in 1994 and had our reception under the oak tree.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe local newspaper printed a photo of Martens on the ladder in his suit and one of the newlyweds kissing under the tree alongside the headline, \u0026lsquo;Wedding of the year\u0026rsquo;. Twenty-four years later, Martens\u0026nbsp;and Renate remain happily married, and the former postman still keeps her letter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the sun began to fade in downtown Eutin, Martens suddenly closed his scrapbook and reached for his coat. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go before it gets dark,\u0026rdquo; he said, grabbing his car keys. \u0026ldquo;Follow me.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xxrns\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFifteen minutes later, I was back in the Dodauer Forest, this time following Martens\u0026rsquo; heavy footsteps towards the old oak. At the circular fence around the tree, he pointed towards two signs: one describing the tree\u0026rsquo;s history, which he wrote; and another reading, \u0026lsquo;May this marriage last a long time!\u0026rsquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2009, after more than 100 years of bringing people together, the Bridegroom\u0026rsquo;s Oak was symbolically married to a 200-year-old chestnut tree near D\u0026uuml;sseldorf. Though 503km apart, the trees remained together for six years until the chestnut started suffering from old age and had to be cut down, leaving the Bridegroom a widow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;When I started coming here, the tree was stronger and healthier,\u0026rdquo; Martens said, pointing up to a series of cables securing the oak\u0026rsquo;s branches. \u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;m not so healthy either, so I suppose we have a special connection.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeveral years ago, arborists detected a fungal infection inside the oak, leading them to lop off a number of its limbs to prevent it from spreading. Around the same time, Martens was diagnosed with leukaemia. Like the tree\u0026rsquo;s branches, he explained that his bones aren\u0026rsquo;t so stable anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xxrx6\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;But I can still climb the ladder,\u0026rdquo; he said, slowly raising himself up its rungs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter peering through the oak\u0026rsquo;s tiny post box, Martens politely excused himself. It was getting late, and he needed to go back and see his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs he left, a slight man with neatly combed hair carrying a small piece of paper came plodding through the forest. When he approached the oak, I cautiously asked if he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mind answering a few questions for a story I was working on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe said he sometimes comes to the tree by himself after work, and handed me his handwritten note. It read: \u0026ldquo;I am a widower, 53 years old, 1.75m tall, living in Ostholstein. I\u0026rsquo;m searching for a slim-medium built loving and loyal partner. Maybe talk soon, Jens.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xxs6d\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You never know,\u0026rdquo; he smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI waved goodbye and started walking out of the woods. At the edge of the clearing, I turned to see Jens atop the ladder, sliding something purple into his jacket pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJoin over three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCTravel/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFacebook\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, or follow us on\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Travel\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTwitter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbc_travel/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eInstagram\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you liked this story,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=ear.bbc.email.we.email-signup\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003esign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

My hands were covered with the meat-and-cheese filling. I imagined Cistercian monks making the dish on these grounds centuries before. But as I learned, there is more than one version of Maultaschen\u0026rsquo;s origin story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xj6hm\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.kloster-maulbronn.de/en/home/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMaulbronn Monastery\u003c/a\u003e is a place of legends.

It also appeared as \u0026lsquo;Mulibrunnen\u0026rsquo;, which suggests a mule (\u003cem\u003e\u0026lsquo;\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eMaultier\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026rsquo;\u003c/em\u003e in German, nicknamed \u0026lsquo;\u003cem\u003eMuli\u003c/em\u003e\u0026rsquo;). Legend says that when the monks set out to find a site for their new monastery, they took a mule, and when the animal stopped for a drink of water they interpreted it as a sign from God that they should stay and build their monastery there. Another version says the mule pawed the ground and they discovered water at that spot. Whatever the truth, a mule drinking from a fountain appears on the town\u0026rsquo;s coat of arms, and the image is also depicted in a red ochre painting above the three-bowl fountain in the monastery\u0026rsquo;s Fountain House.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou may also be interested in:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180102-how-sausage-flavours-the-german-language\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe nation obsessed with sausage\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20171127-the-birthplace-of-the-illuminati\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe birthplace of the Illuminati\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20170425-the-hidden-meaning-in-a-pot-of-stew\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eA hearty stew that unites a nation\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt this \u003ca href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/546\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUnesco World Heritage Site\u003c/a\u003e founded in 1147 \u0026ndash; the best preserved medieval monastic complex north of the Alps \u0026ndash; visitors can take a two-hour-long diploma class in making\u0026nbsp;Maultaschen, large pasta pillows traditionally filled with minced meat and smoked meat (usually pork), spinach, breadcrumbs, herbs and spices. Each oversized Maultaschen measures up to 12cm across, but we were making mini Maultaschen, or \u0026lsquo;Mault\u0026auml;schle\u0026rsquo; in Swabian dialect. Genuine Maultaschen must be produced in Swabia, a historical region that is today incorporated into Baden-W\u0026uuml;rttemberg and the government district of Swabia in Bavaria. In 2009, the European Union recognised\u0026nbsp;Maultaschen\u0026nbsp;as a regional specialty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTraditionally served during Lent in a warm broth garnished with chives, this centuries-old dish is associated with Good Friday, the last Friday of Lent. Catholics, along with some other Christians, are encouraged to refrain from eating meat during Lent, especially on Good Friday \u0026ndash; and the pasta dough was meant to conceal the \u0026lsquo;sinful\u0026rsquo; meat filling.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xj06n\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are three main legends of how Swabian Maultaschen came to exist. The first says the stuffed pouches were a copy of Italian ravioli, introduced from the other side of the Alps by the Waldensians, members of a Christian movement. The second says Maultaschen was a culinary travel souvenir from the German countess Margaret Maultasch, a noble lady who brought the recipe from Tyrol in the Austrian Alps: she was called Maultasch, \u0026lsquo;mouth pocket\u0026rsquo;, due to the shape of her deformed jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe third says the dish originated in the 17th Century during the Thirty Years\u0026rsquo; War, a clever creation by a Cistercian monk of the Maulbronn Cloister. The monks were forbidden to eat meat, so they put it in a pasta pouch to conceal the filling from the eyes of God. Literally translated as \u0026lsquo;mouthbag\u0026rsquo;, the dish\u0026rsquo;s nickname in Swabian dialect,\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eHerrgottsbeschei\u0026szlig;erle\u003c/em\u003e, means \u0026lsquo;small God-cheaters\u0026rsquo;.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e The pasta dough was meant to conceal the \u0026lsquo;sinful\u0026rsquo; meat filling \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Cistercians, a Roman Catholic contemplative order, were a strict bunch: the rule of \u0026lsquo;\u003cem\u003eora et labora\u0026rsquo;\u003c/em\u003e (pray and work) was closely obeyed. Lay monks and priest monks had different roles and occupied separate facilities; lay monks were responsible for physical labour and cooking, and were not permitted to enter any of the rooms designated for priest monks. Priest monks, who were educated and came from noble families, spent most of their time praying and even listened to prayers while they ate in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA priest monk\u0026rsquo;s daily ration was composed of half a kilo of coarse-flour bread and small portions of fish, vegetables, cereals and fruit. \u0026ldquo;They also ate beavers and frogs,\u0026rdquo; said Barbara Gittinger, our monastery guide. Cistercians (apart from the sick) were not permitted to eat anything with four feet, as meat was too luxurious to fit with their poverty values and the renunciation of meat was a sacrifice to God \u0026ndash; but apparently webbed feet were an exception. The lay monks ate separately and received larger portions due to the physical work their positions required.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xj0tb\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter our tour, we entered the kitchen, housed in the monastery\u0026rsquo;s former donkey stable. Ingredients for Maultaschen were laid out on a table: sheets of pasta, parsley, leeks, soaked bread, breadcrumbs, ham, grated cheese, salt and pepper, along with egg to stick the pasta together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe separated into groups to make the filling. \u0026ldquo;We are the lay monks now, because we are doing the physical work and the cooking,\u0026rdquo; Gittinger joked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eParticipants used rulers to measure rectangles from the pre-measured sheet of dough, which we were instructed to fill and fold into 7cm squares. \u0026ldquo;You said 7cm. There is one left,\u0026rdquo; an exacting German participant pointed out to Peter Braun, head of monastery management, who was overseeing the programme. Braun laughed and assured him the extra centimetre of dough would not be a problem. We filled the squares with the cheese-and-ham mixture and closed the pasta by pressing fork tines along the edges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBraun\u0026rsquo;s wife, Angelika, cooked our Mault\u0026auml;schle in chicken broth. Braun and Angelika were married in 1993, the year the monastery was named a World Heritage Site. Angelika was born above what is now the information centre; as a child, she used to ride her bike in the cloister and swing through the choir stalls from the bell ropes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xylyk\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaulbronn Monastery experienced a tumultuous time during the religious and political turmoil of the 16th-Century Reformation. In 1504, the medieval monastery was seized by Duke Ulrich of W\u0026uuml;rttemberg, who later became a Lutheran convert. The Cistercians were able to return twice, but only for brief periods. From 1536, the monastery was no longer Catholic; the monks were forced to leave and Maulbronn became a Protestant establishment, Gittinger explained.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, the complex is still central to local life, offering a seasonal greenmarket and concerts and other events throughout the year. Instead of monks, it houses an academically demanding Protestant secondary school of 100 boarding students; over the centuries, prominent pupils such as Hermann Hesse have passed through its doors. On special occasions, students are sometimes served Maultaschen, which Gittinger told me they love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaultaschen is prepared in a variety of ways including boiled in broth or saut\u0026eacute;ed in butter. Angelika explained that today\u0026rsquo;s Maultaschen is often made with non-traditional fillings including salmon, venison and even blood sausage with sauerkraut \u0026ndash; her favourite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;At home, Peter is the cook, but I make the best,\u0026rdquo; she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xj671\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAngelika shared a more detailed version of the Maultaschen origin story. Two poor boys had come to Maulbronn from a nearby town because their father couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford to feed them. They became lay brothers and were completely included in the monastic life. One of the boys, who worked in the kitchen, received a gift of a large piece of meat. Since meat was forbidden, he had to hide it from his brothers, so he put it in a barrel and added salt to preserve it. After a few weeks, he knew they needed to eat the meat or it would spoil.

This paved the way for some of the country\u0026rsquo;s most extraordinary suspension bridges, though it was John\u0026rsquo;s third and youngest son, Charles, who founded the New Jersey company town.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the start of the 20th Century, John A Roebling\u0026rsquo;s Sons Company already ran a successful wire rope plant in the manufacturing hub of Trenton, approximately 18km up the Delaware River from where Roebling is today. But to complete with prosperous firms like US Steel and Bethlehem Steel, Charles knew the company had to begin producing its own raw material. In 1904, he secured more than 240 acres of central New Jersey land \u0026ndash; much of it former peach orchards \u0026ndash; and constructed a new steel- and wire-making plant comprising more than 70 buildings. Charles then built Roebling village to house the company\u0026rsquo;s employees.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike many others, Borbi's grandparents emigrated to the town of Roebling from Eastern Europe \u0026ndash; in their case Hungary, in what is now part of Romania \u0026ndash; to work in the company plant, where they transformed\u0026nbsp;giant blocks of molten steel into fine strips of wire, galvanised metal, and cast and produced billets (bars of metal) in the mills.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e Without Roebling, some of our greatest modes of transport may not even exist \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach morning, his father and uncles walked from the front doors of their row homes in the part of the village dubbed \u0026lsquo;Gypsy Town\u0026rsquo; for its predominantly Eastern European immigrant population (American-born residents and Swedes first brought over to build the village lived in single family homes beyond 5th Street) to Roebling\u0026rsquo;s Main Gate Building,\u0026nbsp;where they clocked in for work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;At one point, I had 54 relatives living here,\u0026rdquo; Borbi\u0026nbsp;said, a number that wasn\u0026rsquo;t all that uncommon, since Roebling offered its employees fair working conditions and a good standard of living.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;As far as company towns go, there aren\u0026rsquo;t many that are still intact today, let alone ones that have the community feel of Roebling,\u0026rdquo; said Varissa McMickens Blair, executive director of the \u003ca href=\"http://roeblingmuseum.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRoebling Museum\u003c/a\u003e, which opened in the community\u0026rsquo;s former Main Gate Building \u0026ndash; a connector between the village and the mills \u0026ndash; in 2009.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Residents lived in proper homes \u0026ndash; not shared houses or bungalows \u0026ndash;\u0026nbsp;and unlike the majority of worker villages, Roebling paid their employees in real cash, not company scrip. If your spouse was working at the plant and died, you didn\u0026rsquo;t have to move.

Roebling family members made frequent appearances in the mill, addressing many of their employees by name, and while other company towns outlawed drinking and gambling, Roebling welcomed them. According to Borbi, many Roebling residents \u0026ndash; especially those in Gypsy Town \u0026ndash; would even make their own moonshine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Blacksmiths would make the distils at the plant, then break them down, bring them home and set them back up to make home-grown spirits.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese unusual offerings for a company town attracted a skilled workforce and led to a camaraderie both between the employees and with the Roebling family \u0026ndash; which all contributed to keeping the plant running smoothly and efficiently. As did some shrewd thinking on the Roeblings\u0026rsquo; part.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Charles Roebling was all about smart planning,\u0026rdquo; McMickens Blair said, including building the town near the Camden and Amboy Railroad, which connected two of the country\u0026rsquo;s most prosperous cities, New York City and Philadelphia \u0026ndash; a boon when it came to transporting their product to the masses. With this ability to manufacture their own steel, transform it into wire on site and then deliver it, the company\u0026rsquo;s production soared.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xjxv5\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the 1930s and \u0026lsquo;40s, Roebling became one of the US\u0026rsquo; top employers,\u0026nbsp;producing aircraft control wire for bomber planes and steel for anti-submarine nets (including a massive one protecting New York Harbor), and doing their part to literally \u0026lsquo;rewire\u0026rsquo; the course of history. But when the end of World War II led to a reduced need for such materials, the company decided to sell its homes to village residents, and for the first time allowed outsiders not associated with Roebling to purchase property in town. Maintaining just a few managerial roles, in 1952 they sold John A Roebling\u0026rsquo;s Sons Company to Colorado Fuel and Iron Company, and in 1974 both the Trenton and Roebling plants closed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile it\u0026rsquo;s been more than 50 years since Roebling\u0026rsquo;s peak, their contribution to 20th-Century industry is unmistakable. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re boarding a plane or driving across a suspension bridge, Roebling has had a hand in that history, and a visit to the town\u0026rsquo;s Roebling Museum shows just how expansive their reach has been.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere you\u0026rsquo;ll find original pieces of Roebling cable from both the Golden Gate Bridge (which is celebrating 85 years since construction began) and George Washington Bridge, which stretches between Manhattan and northern New Jersey. There\u0026rsquo;s an exhibit on Mercer Automobiles, the Roebling\u0026rsquo;s own early 20th-Century auto manufacturing company that was creating sports cars at the same time the Ford Motor Company was promoting the Model T; and a gallery devoted solely to the building of the Brooklyn Bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xjxfl\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis latter is where you\u0026rsquo;ll find what is undoubtedly one of the museum\u0026rsquo;s most fascinating stories: that of Emily Warren Roebling, the wife of Washington Roebling, who was chief engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge\u0026rsquo;s construction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;When Washington developed caisson disease \u0026ndash; also known as 'the bends' \u0026ndash;\u0026nbsp;and nearly died, Emily actually taught herself the principles of engineering [from learning the principles of stress analysis to how to construct a cable] so that she could step in and help,\u0026rdquo; said McMiekens Blair. An educated and smart woman, as well as Washington's closest confidant, Emily was then able to convince local politicians to allow Washington to retain his role as chief engineer while she took over the day-to-day duties. Emily became one of the world\u0026rsquo;s first female field engineers, paving the way towards gender equality while completing one of the US\u0026rsquo; most iconic architectural structures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e Roebling took care of its people while they were also busy taking care of the world \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe museum also boasts a small gift shop stocking recipe books from Roebling\u0026rsquo;s founding immigrant groups and even the stair-walking Slinky toy, engineer-designed and originally made using Roebling wire.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for Borbi, he just finished writing a book on Roebling town history compiled from more than four decades of research. Growing up, Borbi said, he really didn't realise how special the place was, just that he loved living here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Roebling took care of its people,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;while they were also busy taking care of the world.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCTravel/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFacebook\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, or follow us on\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Travel\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTwitter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbc_travel/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eInstagram\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you liked this story,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=ear.bbc.email.we.email-signup\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003esign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

Weeds and brome grass twist around the rotting remnants of homes that are collapsing in on themselves. And inside a white, squat building with paint peeling off its frame, 84-year-old Elsie Eiler is flipping pork fritters and cracking open beer bottles for a pair of regulars under a sign that reads: \u0026ldquo;Welcome To The World Famous Monowi Tavern. Coldest Beer In Town!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Eiler\u0026rsquo;s husband, Rudy, passed away in 2004, he didn\u0026rsquo;t just leave her to run the tavern, but the whole town.

Although the island is far too small and remote to be permanently settled, it was strategically located in the middle of a valuable shipping route, near Grand Manan Island (pictured), and neither country wanted to give it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1832, Britain built a lighthouse on the island to physically stake its claim.

For the past few hundred years, the only way on and off the island has been by infrequent boat service, and a combination of geographic isolation and traditions harking back to its early British settlers make Tangier feel like it\u0026rsquo;s in a different era than the country that surrounds it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"BodyA\"\u003eTangier's water tower, with a painted cross on one side and blue crab on the other, proudly displays what drives the island: faith and fishing. Here, people bury loved ones in their back gardens, families attend church on Sundays and you won\u0026rsquo;t find alcohol for sale in the island\u0026rsquo;s one grocery store and two restaurants. There are almost no cars on the 1.2-sq-mile island, and residents ride bikes and golf carts on Tangier\u0026rsquo;s one circular road. There is no mobile phone service, police presence or reason to lock your door.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"BodyA\"\u003eBut while Tangier may feel like stepping back into the 1950s, it sounds like stepping back into the 1750s. That\u0026rsquo;s because the inhabitants have retained a unique form of speech that\u0026rsquo;s been passed down from the island\u0026rsquo;s earliest English settlers. Today, Tangier is one of the last places in the US where people still speak with traces of their colonial past.\u003c/p\u003e",

And the rice grows around Panjakent: it is a bit bigger than usual rice and it is used for palav.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, within Tajikistan alone there are more than 200 variations of oshi palav. The classic version includes carrots, onions, garlic, lamb and spices like cumin or coriander. But ingredients like chickpeas, pumpkin or even lemon can be added, giving each dish different colours and flavours. Because recipes tend to be passed down between generations, one family\u0026rsquo;s or village\u0026rsquo;s particular version of osh is a key part of their identity and heritage.\u003c/p\u003e",

White bread, which is made from wheat, was a luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut toward the end of the century, French Protestants, persecuted and even killed under King Louis XIV\u0026rsquo;s Catholic-only regime, began to flee.

They also were committed to continuing the practice abroad. \u0026ldquo;They brought with them the French tradition of bread,\u0026rdquo; Burtchaell said. \u0026ldquo;That was the \u003cem\u003epain blanc\u003c/em\u003e [white bread].

Both bakeries are historical, family-run and rely on only three or four bakers at a shift. But there are key differences. Walsh\u0026rsquo;s, which opened in 1921, still uses their original location \u0026ndash; just down the street from Hickey\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ndash; for baking at night. By day, though, they use a new factory on the outskirts of town, where their bakers show off top-end machinery and where a space is being set up specifically to exhibit the blaa\u0026rsquo;s history and heritage to visitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Hickey\u0026rsquo;s, meanwhile, the bakery remains in its original location in a room behind the shopfront. Technology is at a minimum, with a mixer and a rudimentary machine that helps shape the dough into balls. The slower process means the dough gets more time to sit. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a bit like sourdough, you see. It\u0026rsquo;s all about leaving it to rest, knocking it back and letting it rise again,\u0026rdquo; Hickey said.\u003c/p\u003e",

I was slowly ringing the Faroese island of Streymoy, driving way below the recommended speed and snaking my way along the steep, craggy coastlines as the dark waters of the North Atlantic churned below.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xdfrj\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You know what we call this speed on the Faroe Islands?\u0026rdquo; Ol\u0026iacute; asked me as I rolled up to his farm. \u0026ldquo;Funeral speed,\u0026rdquo; he laughed, referring to the slow crawl of a funeral procession. \u0026ldquo;Now I understand why you were late.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy first stop in the Faroe Islands was supposed to be dinner with Ol\u0026iacute; and his wife Anna, who regularly invite visitors into their home in the sleepy cliffside village of Velbasta\u0026eth;ur to experience \u003cem\u003eheimabl\u0026iacute;dni\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; home-cooked hospitality as part of a supper club they organise. But as my plane descended parallel to staggering cliffs on the island of V\u0026aacute;gar, and as I watched waterfalls gracefully tumble down into the sea, I already sensed I was arriving at a place where surrendering control was inevitable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou may also be interested in:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20171031-the-caribbean-boat-trip-that-cured-my-fear-of-water\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe boat trip that changed my life\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20160713-panic-attacks-are-like-death\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe last place you\u0026rsquo;d want to panic\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180118-dalmatias-fjaka-state-of-mind\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhere doing nothing is a way of life\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVisiting the Faroe Islands was supposed to be a tick off my bucket list. A quick, three-day detour on my way home to Sweden from Iceland meant my itinerary was jam-packed. These 18 remote islands are known for their jarring beauty, and as a photographer, I was coming with a predetermined list of shots I knew I had to have \u0026ndash; like the iconic Mulafossur Waterfall, which pops up when you Google \u0026lsquo;Faroe Islands\u0026rsquo;. Its majestic stream plunges off a cliff and into the sea while the Monopoly-like houses in the village of G\u0026aacute;sadalur sit clustered together in a lush backdrop of green moss.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis isolated hamlet was long closed off to the world, accessible only by boat, helicopter or a three-hour hike. Blasting a tunnel through rock in 2004 instantly made it a mere 20-minute drive from the airport \u0026ndash; never mind that it was in the opposite direction of where I was supposed to meet Ol\u0026iacute; and Anna that evening, which was an hour\u0026rsquo;s drive away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if I would have time to get to the waterfall and then backtrack towards their place, but I hopped in my rental car and went for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, thus began a series of decisions that would derail my itinerary yet rekindle an inner creativity I\u0026rsquo;d lost touch with over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xdf8r\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the time I snapped my cookie-cutter image of Mulafossur and made it to dinner, driving below the speed limit, I was 90 minutes late, and Ol\u0026iacute; and Anna\u0026rsquo;s other guests had been patiently waiting: a group of five young Belgian artists and producers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike my loaded schedule, they were crisscrossing Faroese islands and villages for two weeks \u0026ndash; working on creative projects, flowing with the wind and coming up with imaginative ideas on the fly. They were completely surrendering to where the islands wanted to take them, and more importantly, what they wanted to show them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe youngest, a noted fashion photographer in Belgium named Charlotte, was in her early 20s and was shooting Faroese residents in whimsical situations. She was gaining enough trust from strangers to pose them in improvised ways \u0026ndash; like hiding them behind bushes and stonewalls or arranging fishermen with lobsters and farmers with lambs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRaphael, a popular singer-songwriter in Belgium, was recording the sounds of the Faroe Islands \u0026ndash; the bleating of sheep, humming of ferries and crashing of rocks \u0026ndash; as they travelled through it. Rounding out the crew was Sylvie, their producer; videographer Brice; and Nizar, Charlotte\u0026rsquo;s manager.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e I already sensed I was arriving at a place where surrendering control was inevitable \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile wafts of Anna\u0026rsquo;s baked curried cod filled the minimalist abode, I listened to my dining companions passionately explain their projects. I found them intriguing. Surrounded by sheep-wool throws, our conversation ebbed to the team\u0026rsquo;s next destination: the island of Hestur.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Hestur is right there,\u0026rdquo; Ol\u0026iacute; said, pointing through the floor-to-ceiling windows across his cliff-side backyard. The only way to get there was by an irregular ferry from Gamlar\u0026aelig;tt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur conversation ended abruptly as Charlotte rushed over, fingers flailing in the air. I recognised that light bulb of ideas that had gone off brightly within her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I would like to photograph you on the roof!\u0026rdquo; she announced to initial trepidation from our hosts.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You know what? When you say yes to life, you open doors,\u0026rdquo; Ol\u0026iacute; finally replied, looking at Anna. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s why we run these dinners and invite strangers into our home. Who knows how the evening ends!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithin minutes, a red chair, an ironing board and two Border Collies were passed up as props onto Ol\u0026iacute; and Anna\u0026rsquo;s moss-covered roof. Curiosity soon led neighbours to slowly file out of their own homes, cameras in tow. The energy coursing through the cool evening air inspired everyone to start snapping away, including me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xdflk\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis made me wonder what I was like when I was Charlotte\u0026rsquo;s age, 15 years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had similar creative spells swirling within me but I never fully embraced them. I wanted to be a travel photographer, and the travel photography I saw in magazines often captured a place in a very specific, straightforward way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI also used to be an oil painter and my travel photos initially inspired my paintings until I switched over to photography as a medium of artistic expression. As the years went on and my photos began appearing in different magazines, I realised the ones chosen for publication fit someone else\u0026rsquo;s voice: the publication\u0026rsquo;s, not mine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut as I watched Charlotte improvise on the roof, using the grandeur of those outer islands as a backdrop, I began to question what capturing a place truly means. After all, in a single shot Charlotte artistically staged, I saw Ol\u0026iacute;\u0026rsquo;s extroversion and Anna\u0026rsquo;s introversion, revealing who they were as people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e When you say yes to life, you open doors \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wanted to surrender to that creative force that seemed to envelope Charlotte, so I decided to ditch my itinerary and follow the Belgians to Hestur, the quiet island resting like a giant in the mist across the fjord.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf they would let me, that is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we gathered back around the table, the question tumbled out before I could stop myself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Can I\u0026hellip; you know\u0026hellip; follow you to Hestur?\u0026rdquo; I was unsure of my own voice. These strangers were so much younger than me, and the last thing I wanted was to be the old lady cramping their style.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Yes, of course you can!\u0026rdquo; Sylvie responded. Nods from the others supported her invitation. Later, I drove them to Ol\u0026iacute;\u0026rsquo;s farm, a few kilometres from his house, where the Belgians were going to sleep in the barn, right above his Icelandic horses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, we set off together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xdg8x\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHestur means \u0026lsquo;horse\u0026rsquo; in Faroese and there are no roads on its 6 sq km. The island is home to a colony of guillemot seabirds and deep caves where famous Faroese musicians play concerts as waves thrash against rock walls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe were meeting Tr\u0026oacute;ndur, a local cod fisherman in his early 50s. During his youth, there were at least 80 residents, but now, Hestur had dwindled into an accidental retirement community of around 21 people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe arrived to dead silence and no Tr\u0026oacute;ndur. As the ferry disappeared, we fanned out, wandering down desolate lanes lined with hobbit-like cottages, turf roofs and bright red window frames. We spotted one curtain half-pulled back. Someone was watching us. The second we inched closer, it fell back down, shutting us outside.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI began to second-guess this detour and returned to the shore where the ferry had dropped us off. Meanwhile, Nizar, Raphael and Brice found a deflated ball and started an impromptu game of football, while Sylvie and Charlotte continued exploring the village.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e I wanted to surrender to that creative force \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbout 45 minutes later, a sturdy fisherman with freckles and ginger-coloured hair tramped up and introduced himself as Tr\u0026oacute;ndur. Alongside him was a stone-faced older man holding a pair of binoculars named Jermond. Soon, Charlotte started photographing Jermond in playful poses with his binoculars.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Charlotte worked, an elderly woman walked by with a basket of laundry under her arms and stopped out of curiosity. She only spoke Danish and Faroese, but within seconds, we had learned her name: Hermanda.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the next two hours, Hestur became the Belgians\u0026rsquo; studio. Charlotte found a wheelbarrow and convinced Hermanda with a series of smiles and gestures to sit in it and pose, while Raphael recorded a soundtrack of Hestur: the football being kicked, the slow hum of the ferry as it turned away. Watching these creative artists reignited something deep within me that I recognised from my youth: unbridled imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xdglt\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEventually, Raphael lowered his microphone and looked up at the mountain behind Hermanda\u0026rsquo;s maroon cottage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I want to go up there,\u0026rdquo; he said to me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Are you a climber?\u0026rdquo; I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; he responded, before sprinting up the mossy terrain as far as he could and crawling on all fours as it became steeper.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I watched him go up and skip back down, I didn\u0026rsquo;t long for his youth and agility. I longed for that time in my life when I never second-guessed my instincts and talent. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t a climber, but he knew he could climb that mountain if he pushed himself. I realised that I could become that master photographer I\u0026rsquo;ve always dreamed of \u0026ndash; I just needed to keep pushing myself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter her impromptu photo session, Hermanda invited us into her modest cottage for tea. Raphael found her old acoustic guitar and started serenading us with unreleased songs. I could feel tears welling up behind my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis detour to Hestur was showing me that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t even begun to explore what I was capable of as an artist. When I conceded to their flow, the Faroe Islands showed me beauty in jaggedness, euphoria in unpredictability and reverence that comes with grandeur.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e I could become that master photographer I\u0026rsquo;ve always dreamed of \u0026ndash; I just needed to keep pushing myself \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Belgians were using this backdrop as the inspiration for their work and following their imaginations. And now the islands were giving me the spark that I\u0026rsquo;d subconsciously been seeking. I had become tired of editing my voice to fit other people\u0026rsquo;s platforms. I saw my youth reflecting back at me and realised my craft had become predictable and safe. I'd let time box that creative person in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI suddenly found myself angry and disappointed at myself. I was sitting across from Charlotte who studied me with concern, watching these emotions play out across my face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I was \u003cem\u003esupposed\u003c/em\u003e to come here with you,\u0026rdquo; I finally said, locking eyes with hers. She nodded, revealing an acknowledging smile.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat was all I needed to say.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05xdfzr\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn hour later, Tr\u0026oacute;ndur gave us a ride back to Streymoy Island on his fishing trawler. Rain began to fall hard, darkening the sky and leaving Hestur a resting giant in the mist once again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I drove back to my hotel, snaking along that same steep coastline, my mind wandered back to Hestur. I had rediscovered what it meant to surrender to one\u0026rsquo;s own creativity and voice.

The intense tropical heat hit me like a tidal wave, soaking me in sweat the moment I stepped outside. Maybe it bothered me less when I was 16, but I have since grown accustomed to Germany\u0026rsquo;s crisp climate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;\u003cem\u003eAqui se\u0026ntilde;or, aqui!\u003c/em\u003e\u0026rdquo; A dozen taxi drivers vied for my business the moment I set foot on the pavement outside the arrivals gate. Desperate to escape the cacophony, I sought refuge in the closest taxi, and with the radio at full volume, we began the hour-long drive south to the village of Codazzi, my father\u0026rsquo;s hometown. With the windows rolled down, the thick Colombian heat filled the taxi, colliding with the energetic notes of \u003cem\u003evallenato\u003c/em\u003e, northern Colombia\u0026rsquo;s traditional folk music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou may also be interested in:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20170328-the-worlds-happiest-country\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe world\u0026rsquo;s happiest country?\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20160523-an-end-to-second-hand-coffee\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe man who saved Colombian coffee\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20171001-how-italians-influenced-a-south-american-dialect\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe slang that transformed Spanish\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe voice emanating from the speakers was that of a man desperately trying to win back the heart of his lost love. His forlorn lyrics \u0026ndash; \u003cem\u003eVuelve mi amor, Vuelve!\u003c/em\u003e (Come back to me darling, come back to me!) \u0026ndash; were accompanied by the reedy notes of an accordion. \u0026ldquo;People here don\u0026rsquo;t tell stories \u0026ndash; we sing them with the sound of accordions,\u0026rdquo; said Emilio, my taxi driver, with a smile on his face as he turned up the volume and starting to sing along.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05wy9vj\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven without the accordion\u0026rsquo;s hum filling my ears, its influence was hard to miss. C\u0026eacute;sar\u0026rsquo;s streets were littered with murals and monuments depicting the pleated instrument, and its wheezing melodies seemed to ooze from every open window.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy father had always loved vallenato music, so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t shocked to discover that it was the soundtrack to life in his boyhood home. What is surprising, however, is that the driving force behind Colombia\u0026rsquo;s acclaimed folk music is not Colombian at all \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s German.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe accordion travelled to Colombia in the mid-19th Century aboard German merchant ships that landed at La Guajira, the northernmost tip of South America. The German sailors traded their musical instruments with Colombians in exchange for food and other wares. When the Germans set sail for home, they unknowingly left behind the foundations of a lasting legacy: it didn\u0026rsquo;t take long for local troubadours to incorporate the accordion into their repertoires, and Colombian poets followed suit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e People here don\u0026rsquo;t tell stories \u0026ndash; we sing them with the sound of accordions \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eSoon, the accordion become an ensemble instrument. Musicians paired its distinct sound with those of local instruments, like the \u003cem\u003ecaja\u003c/em\u003e (a Colombian version of a bongo drum) and the \u003cem\u003eguacharaca\u003c/em\u003e (a ribbed wooden instrument you rub with a fork to produce a vibrating sound), replacing the \u003cem\u003egaita \u003c/em\u003e(Colombian flute) as the primary instrument in folk music. Although French and Italian accordions also found their way to Colombia, it was Germany\u0026rsquo;s Hohner-brand diatonic accordion that best suited the average Colombian singer's vocal pitch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe upbeat rhythms and poetic lyrics of vallenato quickly attracted a fierce following, and today, more than 150 years after its arrival in the country, the German accordion has become an integral part of Colombian storytelling. Twentieth Century Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel Garc\u0026iacute;a M\u0026aacute;rquez declared himself a big admirer of the genre \u0026ndash; he even \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/07/07/484944084/in-colombia-preserving-songs-that-tell-stories\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edubbed\u003c/a\u003e his masterpiece, One Hundred Years of Solitude, a \u0026lsquo;vallenato song of 400 pages\u0026rsquo;. Today, kids across Colombia ask for accordions for Christmas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05wy9vz\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs my cousin Cocho and I sipped Scotch \u0026ndash; a surprisingly common drink in this part of the country \u0026ndash; in front of his house in Codazzi, more than a dozen neighbours stopped by to greet us, some even sitting down to share a drink and a story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Did you know Francisco \u0026lsquo;El Hombre\u0026rsquo; defeated the devil playing the accordion?\u0026rdquo; one asked while refilling my glass. \u0026ldquo;Of course. He was the best accordion player in history,\u0026rdquo; I responded, remembering the many times my father told me \u003ca href=\"http://www.mincultura.gov.co/areas/patrimonio/publicaciones/Documents/LIBRO%20FRANCISCO%20EL%20HOMBRE.compressed.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe story\u003c/a\u003e as a kid. The vallenato musician was returning home from the city of Riohacha on the La Guajira coast when the devil appeared and challenged him to an accordion duel, which Francisco won. It was just one of many regional tall tales starring accordion players.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next morning I followed my family east of town to the banks of a slow-moving river, where Codazzi residents regularly gather for lunches of \u003cem\u003esancocho\u003c/em\u003e, a soup made with pork, beef, chicken, potato and plantain. In the shade of mango trees, families crowded around mixing bowls and cutting boards, their hips swaying to the punchy vallenato melodies pouring from portable radios. \u0026ldquo;Turn that volume up!\u0026rdquo; my 83-year-old grandmother demanded, her hands deftly wielding a paring knife that vanquished one potato after the next. It seemed like everyone was competing for the title of loudest and most festive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05wy9w9\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLater that afternoon, I joined my cousin Daniel for a swim in the river. \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t leave Codazzi without attending a \u003cem\u003epiqueria \u003c/em\u003e[a \u0026lsquo;duel\u0026rsquo; between two accordion players],\u0026rdquo; he told me as we floated lazily. \u0026ldquo;Let me take you tonight.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI could hear the bellow of the accordions before I even entered the venue. People cheered while the musicians\u0026rsquo; hands flew over the keys, releasing a complex string of notes as they pumped life into the instrument with the rhythmic push and pull of its flexible body. When one contestant finished, his competitor responded with a verse even more complicated in an attempt to mock his opponent. Although this was an amateur competition, you could see these contenders had been playing the accordion their whole life. As naturally as breathing, the musicians filled the accordions\u0026rsquo; bodies with air and expelled it to release detailed musical phrases that delighted their audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05wy9t3\"}}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eC\u0026eacute;sar is not the only region that celebrates the sounds of the accordion; vallenato has spread throughout the rest of the country. In 2015 it was inscribed on Unesco\u0026rsquo;s list of \u003ca href=\"https://ich.unesco.org/en/USL/traditional-vallenato-music-of-the-greater-magdalena-region-01095\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIntangible Cultural Heritage\u003c/a\u003e, and Colombians commemorate their love of the music every spring at the \u003ca href=\"http://festivalvallenato.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFestival de la Leyenda Vallenata\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was raised on vallenato \u0026ndash; I even studied the accordion as a child. But after living in Germany for more than eight years, my appreciation for the genre had waned. Several days later when I boarded my flight back to Europe, the sounds of accordions were still ringing in my ears. This time I would be more careful not to leave this part of my culture too far behind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCTravel/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFacebook\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, or follow us on\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Travel\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTwitter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbc_travel/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eInstagram\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you liked this story,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=ear.bbc.email.we.email-signup\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003esign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

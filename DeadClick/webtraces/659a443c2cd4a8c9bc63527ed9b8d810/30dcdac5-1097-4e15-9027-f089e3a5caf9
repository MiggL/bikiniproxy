			<ul>
				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#845f59;" alt="">This module describes the extraordinary story of how working men won the vote. It discusses the rise of the self-help movement, and shows how the 'swinish multitude' were recast in the minds of the political elite as the 'industrious working class', resulting, in 1867, in the enfranchisement of working men in the towns and cities.				</a></li>

				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#2a4941;" alt="">England's earliest colonial experiments are explored by unpacking the idea of 'plantations', the idea of planting Englishness in foreign soil. We look at the Elizabethan plantations in County Down, Ireland (the root of the 'troubles' that were to plague Ireland for centuries). And we contrast the Irish story with the story of plantations in the New World - America.				</a></li>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#156b8c;" alt="">Andrew describes how Elizabeth I fell victim to smallpox in 1562, and he explores the treatments proscibed for smallpox by Lady Grace Mildmay, a gentlewoman and an amateur doctor of the early 17th century. What do her cures (arsenic being one!) tell us about Elizbethan attutudes to disease and the human body? 				</a></li>

				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#156b8c;" alt="">In 1616, the Native American princess Pocahontas came to Shakespeare's London - and died there, of smallpox. Her story reflects a greater tragedy impacting the indiginous population of the Americas. Lacking immunity to European diseases, they were devastated by disease in the decades that followed 'first contact'.				</a></li>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#156b8c;" alt="">In 1721, six condemned felons in Newgate Prison were inoculated with live smallpox. It was the first controlled experiment in immunology in British history, carried out after the exotic traveller Lady Mary Wortley Montagu had witnessed similar inoculations in Turkey. From the depths of the Old Bailey, Andrew describes how the experiment proved a milestone, advancing our understanding of the treatment of disease.				</a></li>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#156b8c;" alt="">In 1796, inspired by an old wives' tale about the fabled beauty of milkmaids, Edward Jenner used a virus harvested from the udder of a diseased cow to immunize against smallpox - with astonishing success. Andrew tells the unlikely story of Jenner's genius, and of how a country doctor made a seismic breakthrough in the struggle against disease.  				</a></li>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#156b8c;" alt="">Andrew explores the astonishing speed with which Jenner's vaccine was adopted, across Britain and beyond - leading many people, including the American President Thomas Jefferson, to conclude that the eradication of smallpox must surely be just around the corner. 				</a></li>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#156b8c;" alt="">For many, Jenner's 'cowpox' vaccine seemed strange and alien. Its bovine origins scared many. And when science weighed in alongside popular superstition, the stage was set for an anti-vaccination backlash that would persist for a century.				</a></li>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#156b8c;" alt="">In 1853, Parliament passed a law making compulsory the vaccination of all infant children in Britain. The Vaccination Act provoked a furious protest. It was seen as an unprecedented encroachment by the state into the freedom of the individual to make informed medical choices. The story illustrates a public concern that reverberates into the modern age. 				</a></li>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#156b8c;" alt="">In 1896 - a century on from Jenner's discovery of the cowpox vaccine - a smallpox epidemic hit the English cathedral city of Gloucester. It was recorded in harrowing pitcures taken by a local photographer. Why was Glouceser hit so badly when a vaccine was so readily available? The answer reveals the difficulty of imposing public health in Victorian Britain.				</a></li>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#156b8c;" alt="">In 1967, the World Health Organization set a ten year deadline for the global eradication of smallpox. It was an act of unprecedented human ambition in the face of a disease responsible for an estimated 10 million deaths a year. How did they achieve the seemingly impossible? Andrew sets out to explain. 				</a></li>

				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#156b8c;" alt="">For thirty years, the world has been free of smallpox. And yet the virus survives, in laboratories in Russia and the USA. Andrew debates the ethics of keeping smallpox even in lab conditions, focusing on the tragic story of Janet Parker, the very last victim of smallpox, who was infected in a lab in the University of Birmingham in 1978. 				</a></li>

In this module we hear Black Elk's account of his childhood, when the bison roamed the Plains - before the coming of the Wasichu, the 'pale faces'. And at the Pine Ridge reservation today, we witness a pow-wow - a glimpse of the old Lakota culture preserved in the heart of the modern USA.				</a></li>

				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#7c7c0a;" alt="">In 1846 a young journalist from Boston called Francis Parkman made a journey down the Oregon Trail, to experience the life of the Oglala Sioux. This module tells his story: how he made contact with the Oglala west of Fort Laramie, Wyoming; how he described the customs of the tribe; and how, feverish with excitement, he participated in an exhilarating Oglala ritual: the Great Buffalo Hunt.				</a></li>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#7c7c0a;" alt="">In 1849, the Hester family from Indiana embarked on an epic journey west by covered wagon to California. Their 14-year-old daughter Sallie wrote a diary describing the experience, and this module tells her story. It follows the Hesters across the Plains and over the treacherous Sierra Nevadas - past the place where the Donner Party met their grisly end just three years earlier.				</a></li>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#7c7c0a;" alt="">With the coming of the railroads, the settlement of the Great Plains began - a process believed by many to be the 'manifest destiny' of the American people, and facilitated by the promise of free land. But first, the homesteaders had to tame a forbidding landscape, and this was no easy task. The module follows the story of Uriah and Mattie Oblinger, whose letters, written in 1872-3, describe the creation of their 'sodhouse', a house made from the only building material available: the matted roots of the Prairie grass itself.				</a></li>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#7c7c0a;" alt="">This module tells the story of the prospectors, focusing on the story of the South Dakota Gold Rush of 1874. The Black Hills had been promised to the Lakota 'as long as grass grows and rivers flow' - but when Custer's expedition established the presence of gold in the hills, these promises to the Native Americans were soon broken. The module describes the experiences of Annie Tallent, one of the first prospectors to enter the hills, and the only woman amongst the Gordon Party of 1874.				</a></li>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#7c7c0a;" alt="">This module tells the story of the great cattle drives in the years after the American Civil War, when cheap southern beef was driven north out of Texas to the railheads of Kansas, to feed the cities in the North and on the eastern seaboard. Teddy Blue Abbott, a cowboy from those days, recalls the drover's life; he recalls how the trail became impassable once the homesteaders fenced off the Plains; and he recalls his last great drive, north to Montana, where be bought some land and exchanged the life of a drover for the life of a rancher.				</a></li>

				<li><a href="" class="yellowCopy" style="background-color:#7c7c0a;" alt="">The clash between Native and White America is a story of betrayal and broken promises. In 1876, the conflict reached its climax at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Black Elk describes his part in the battle as a 13-year-old warrior - and he describes the tragic years that followed, when the Native Americans found themselves hemmed into the reservations, and "the nation's hoop was broken".				</a></li>

<p>When microlending began in the 1970s, the idea was simple: To raise people out of poverty, microfinance institutions would provide small loans—from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars—to people who wanted to start businesses. Back then, borrowers and their businesses were treated the same—whether woman or man, weaver or farmer. Loan options were strikingly similar, with rigid terms and conditions, which limited the number of poor who could be reached. In many cases, these limits also stifled creativity and individualism in the development of financial services for the poor.</p>
<p>Lately, this one-size-fits-all approach is being reconsidered. To make microlending more effective, experts agree on five interconnected ideas and innovations: flexibility, holistic initiatives, technology, research and, finally, personalization.</p>
<p>From experts in the field, here are five ways to make microlending better.</p>
<p><strong>1) Increase flexibility </strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, microfinance organizations have required clients to use loans solely for investment in their own business, says Joanna Ledgerwood, editor of <em>The New Microfinance Handbook</em> and director of Financial Sector Deepening Zambia (FSDZ). But, she adds, many use loans to pay for food or other expenses, such as a new roof. This is not bad, she says, as long as the borrower has the means to repay the loan and interest. Indeed, by insisting that borrowers invest only in their businesses, “We sometimes force clients to lie,” Ledgerwood says. If instead, for example, MFIs were willing to give a loan to a farmer to survive the “hungry season”—the time when a farmer’s stockpiles run out before the next harvest—she wouldn’t have to pre-sell her harvest at, say, a 50 percent discount to pay for food during that time. Instead, she could hold on to her crop and sell it at market prices when it’s harvested or even later. “If the objective of microlending is to increase incomes and improve the quality of people’s lives, credit that allows a family to eat during the hungry season can do exactly that,” she says.</p>
<p><strong>2) Use holistic financing</strong></p>
<p>Some MFIs, including FINCA (the Foundation for International Community Assistance), are beginning to look at microlending from a more holistic perspective. In Uganda, FINCA recently began giving loans for the purchase of solar lanterns. These lanterns, which have a two-year warranty—unusual in a market flooded with cheap and unreliable products—cost $40 each, and replace hazardous and costly kerosene lamps. The lanterns provide light for children to study at night, give adults more time to work and can be used to charge mobile phones and power a radio. FINCA estimates that the lanterns, usually financed on a six- to eight-month loan repayment schedule, actually pay for themselves in six months with the savings customers accrue on phone charging and fuel costs. Other possible energy-efficient solutions FINCA is exploring—mainly developed by recent engineering graduates in the U.S.—include solar-powered water purification and irrigation pumps.</p>
<p><strong>3) Employ research</strong></p>
<p>For years, the effectiveness of microlending programs has been measured primarily by the rate of loan repayment as well as through anecdotal information. But just because a client repays a loan does not mean the business has been profitable. A borrower may take on more debt, sell assets (like a cow), go without food or even take children (usually girls) out of school to help work and make the money needed to repay the loan. Rather than assume that loan repayment guarantees positive impact, Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), an international research and policy nonprofit, maintains that the same rigorous controlled studies used to determine drug effectiveness should be used to measure the success of financial programs. These types of studies already have shown the limits of microlending. “Loans are an important financial tool, but only one tool, and not a universal tool,” says Beniamino Savonitto, initiative director of the Global Financial Inclusion Initiative at IPA. “There are other products low-income people want and need, like savings accounts.” For example, he says, it makes sense to help farmers put aside money to cover food costs during the hunger months, rather than encourage them to take out expensive loans.</p>
<p><strong>4) Take advantage of technology</strong></p>
<p>Technology is the microfinance game changer. Through big data analysis of mobile phone usage and money transfers, lenders can evaluate potential customers and make loans without making clients travel long distances to bank branches. This makes the process faster and easier, but still secure, says Rupert Scofield, FINCA president and CEO and author of <em>The Social Entrepreneur’s Handbook.</em> Using mobile money services also lowers costs both for banks (they don’t have to invest in buildings and staffs) and for clients (they can save on bank fees). Technology is also helping women, says Mary Ellen Iskenderian, CEO of Women’s World Banking. Being able to use cellphones to get loans or make payments or deposits—instead of walking many miles to make transactions—is extremely convenient. Women also value confidentiality. They may not want their husbands, fathers, sons or neighbors to know that they’re saving or to have access to those funds—fearing that family members will take this money and use it for other purposes. Thus, if the cellphone is in the woman’s name, mobile money accounts can provide much-needed privacy and security.</p>
<p><strong>5) Make it personal</strong></p>
<p>“We need to tackle the complex needs of women and their families, which a loan can only partly address,” Iskenderian says. “Microlending will be more effective if there are other safety-net and asset-building products in place—like insurance, savings and pensions—so that families can be secure and repay that loan.” This also means retraining the frontline staff who are making the loans, so they can better meet clients’ individual needs. In Gujarat, India for example, many women microentrepreneurs pursue the potentially profitable business of buffalo dairy farming. But a buffalo costs 30,000 rupees (roughly US$473, as of April 29, 2015), and the MFIs in that state do not lend more than 10,000 rupees ($158). So women are forced to borrow from other sources to start their businesses. “The key factor is listening to the client,” Iskenderian says. “Financial services tailored to clients’ needs—and women’s needs in particular—will be more effective at really making a difference.”</p>

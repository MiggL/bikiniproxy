<p><strong>South Africa</strong> &#8211; August 2002</p>
<p>I just got back from a two week vacation in South Africa. My main aim for heading out to the southern tip of Africa during its winter season was to dive with the Great White sharks, the most feared apex predator in the sea, as one is almost guaranteed the chance to get up close and personal with them this time of the year. Then there was the Billabong Pro Surfing Competition in Jeffrey&#8217;s Bay&#8211;one of the world&#8217;s surfing Mecca&#8217;s. Finally, it was a chance to revisit this wonderful country and see what changes had occurred since the referendum giving the blacks the right to vote in 1994, and the formal dismantling of the apartheid system (I had last visited SA on the eve of this referendum).</p>
<p>I arrived in Capetown  after an impossibly cramped flight from New York. South African Airways has a monopoly on direct flights into SA from the US, and like any good capitalist they exploit it. There is ZERO legroom&#8211; nada, zip. As far as I can make out, SA Airways simply copied the design of the notorious Robben Island Prison (Mandela&#8217;s home for many a lonely year) bus they used to shuttle political prisoners around the island in. Even the tanned and well-muscled surfers sporting Antipodean accents on their way to the Billabong surfing competition, couldn&#8217;t stop me thinking about my aching limbs. It&#8217;s a wonder they don&#8217;t have doctors aboard treating passengers for arterial thrombosis! I was therefore glad to get out and stretch my legs after 17 hours of flying, and immediately made a beeline for the restaurants and jazz clubs at the V&amp;A Waterfront. Despite Capetown supposedly being safer than Jo-burg at night, it didn&#8217;t take long for three drunk teenagers, one with a stick, to accost me and demand money because they were hungry. I  got them to accompany me to the Waterfront and bought them KFC specials and there were no mishaps, but after that I went around by cab like all the other tourists. Crime has definitely taken a turn for the worse, as unemployed, uneducated people from what were formerly black homelands (they previously were not allowed to leave these homelands) have come to the cities in search of non-existent work. According to Interpol, Jo&#8217;burg is now the world&#8217;s most dangerous city and the carjack capital of the world. Further south, Caltex made the mistake of building a service station in a black township near Capetown and all its gas tanks got cleaned out in the first night! They didn&#8217;t even make it to opening day. Now a bright new empty service station just sits there since even Caltex can&#8217;t afford a 24 hour small army to patrol it, and 75,000 people have to make do with importing their gas in jerry cans from Capetown as a result. Finally, every home I saw in SA was surrounded by walls, gates and/or barbed wire, and has a plaque announcing which of the competing brands of armed response companies (mostly South African former white police and army run) services it. It&#8217;s quite something.</p>
<p><strong>Shark Raving Mad</strong></p>
<p>The weather was very poor in SA for much of July&#8211;severe floods and the coldest winter since 1968. There was even snow on TableMountain! All ocean diving was also cancelled for a few days due to 11 meter swells. So I headed to the Two Oceans Aquarium in Capetown for a dive in the frigid (13C) Kelp Forest Tank (Atlantic Ocean) and  warmer Predator Shark Tank (Indian Ocean)&#8211; these being the two oceans bathing the Cape. The Aquarium is also one of the only two places in the world (the other being in England) where you can dive in an original copper helmet and canvas suit worn by divers at the turn of the 20th century. They have to winch you down into the aquarium as you are laden with 70 kgs of weight, and it is very difficult to put one foot in front of the other. It is even heavy and cumbersome to walk around in this get-up at depth with little gravity, so I have renewed respect for the divers of yesteryear.  My legs were sore for three days after this dive from carrying so much  weight around. On the positive side, it took two cute guys to dress me for this dive&#8211;probably the first and last time this will ever happen&#8211;and I was the star attraction in the Aquarium that day, with tons of kids waving and oohing and aahing. Finally, the sharks are attracted to copper despite the large bubble stream a diver generates diving in this rig, so the Aquarium&#8217;s five ragged sand tooth sharks (one, a female named Maxine, came in at 4.5 meters long) kept brushing my helmet and made for a memorable dive.</p>
<p>The weather then broke and I was lucky to get two days of awesome diving with the fearsome (they get to be about 5 meters long in SA) but magnificent Great Whites. Gansbaai, a two hour drive east of Capetown, is the Great White Shark capital of the world. (Great Whites are also found off South Australia and the Californian coast, but you have to be very lucky to see one there as the species in those waters are mid-ocean feeders rather than the surface feeders that patrol the SA waters, and swoop upwards at anything that looks like a seal.) DyerIsland, which is a thirty minute boat ride from Gansbaai, has a large colony of CapeFur Seals which explains the presence of the Great White in such abundance. Our boat stopped just off DyerIsland, and the divemaster started scooping out shark liver oil from buckets into the aptly named waters of Shark Alley. They also hung a wooden cutout of a CapeFur Seal at the back of the boat to attract the sharks, and within minutes we had two Great Whites circling the boat. Tuna heads were then lowered on ropes to further interest the sharks, the operators always being careful to never let the sharks sink their teeth into the tuna or the seal cutout, so they wouldn&#8217;t lose interest. Once everybody had got a good topside look at the sharks, the steel dive cage was lowered about 5 meters into the water. Often the sharks get scared when this happens and bolt for good, but we were in luck, as an especially inquisitive female kept circling. The first two divers descended into the cage, initially on snorkel, but the shark continued to cooperate and they were quickly able to switch to breathing surface supplied air from regulators, as no bubbles were going to scare this shark away. Within minutes, one of the divers had exhausted his film and had to surface to reload, and it was my turn in the cage. The divemaster started pouring more shark liver oil right over the cage (Warning: it takes about 5 cycles in the washing machine to get the smell out of your wet suit!) and the shark made right for the cage at top speed, stopped and then veered off without ramming the cage. It is very rare for a shark to charge a cage, and since we had to steady ourselves and our cameras while in the cage with our fingers hanging outside the cage, the other diver and I both let out involuntary screams of fear at this unexpected event. We got a lot of good natured teasing from the passengers and crew when we emerged from the cage as they could hear our screams through the regulators, but none of the non-diving passengers volunteered to get in and have a snorkel when offered this once in a lifetime opportunity! I&#8217;ve dived with tiger sharks in the Bikini atolls, large hammerheads in Costa Rica and Papua New Guinea, and love having a chance to get close to these graceful creatures (they are rarely dangerous to divers), but having an open-mouthed Jaws make a beeline toward you really gets the adrenalin going. My camera was similarly terrified and chose to freeze at this moment, so you&#8217;ll just have to take my word for it, or check out the attached photos.</p>
<p>Apart from the shark action, Gansbaai is close to some lovely little villages where you can stay in B&amp;Bs where humpbacks and southern right whales breach right outside your balcony during their breeding season.You go to sleep listening to their singing. Gansbaai is in the heart of Afrikaans country. Tourism is still relatively new here and you have gruff and tough fisher folk taking you out on their boats. They sure don&#8217;t like the &#8220;new Africa&#8221; and the fact that, in their opinion, &#8220;the Kaffirs (derogatory Afrikaans name for blacks) have taken the country to the dogs.&#8221; Still, almost all thank God for Mandela and his message of forgiveness and reconciliation, otherwise they are sure there would have been a bloodbath similar to Zimbabwe&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>A Visit to a Black Township</strong></p>
<p>I also visited two black townships and the remains of District 6&#8211;a once vibrant section of Capetown-and home to blacks, coloreds and Indians. District 6 was razed over a 20 year period  when the government decided they wanted a white cordon sanitaire around Capetown, and forcibly moved 60,000 people to the bleak Cape flats, and dumped the rubble from  their homes to make the V&amp;A Waterfront. The colored guide we had showed us where he used to live and go to school and the District 6 Museum has photos of bustling streets and homes, where today only fields, a police station and a technical college stand.</p>
<p>We then went into the black townships. These are pretty bleak:  people live in homes and shop from stores made out of corrugated steel, or ship containers. Like the white homes, these shacks are also surrounded by barbed wire. However, the stark exterior belied the warm welcome of the township children who ran to hold our arms and hug us, and the adults were not the least hostile or resentful towards us in the areas we visited.</p>
<p>In KhayelitshaTownship, we met up with Vicky, who has started a B&amp;B in her container shack.  Fifteen dollars a night gets you transportation and from Capetown; a bed; some warm water from a bucket to wash;  rice and soup for dinner and breakfast; and central heating courtesy of an oil drum filled with coal which can spark up during the night and burn the entire shack down, and often does. In fact, two days before we visited Vicky&#8217;s, foreign guests of hers were awoken to screams in the middle of the night, and  had to help the owners of the shack next door move their belongings out to save them from fire. These guests felt so sorry for Vicky&#8217;s neighbors that they bought them a new home, and workmen were installing the brand new $200 container in the lot next to Vicky&#8217;s while we visited. Also included in the price of your stay, is a trip to the local shebeen (Irish name for illicit grog shop which has somehow made it into the lexicon of SA blacks, as they were not allowed to buy alcohol under apartheid), and a visit to Vicky&#8217;s kids&#8217; school. Vicky takes reservations over the internet should you feel so inclined to give this experience a go. Check out I&#8217;m tempted to try this next time I&#8217;m in SA, as visiting these townships and talking with the folks there really gives you a good picture of what life is like for the majority of the people in SA, and what it was like under apartheid. </p>
<p> <strong>Golden&#8211;He Keeps His Daughters in Front of the TV </strong></p>
<p>After leaving Vicky&#8217;s place, we went to visit Golden, a former gold mine worker, who now supports a wife, four young daughters and a baby boy by forming bits of tin and cans into the shape of flowers and painting them the color of his name. It is rare to find a TV in a township home since electricity is not always easy to come by, but when we visited Golden&#8217;s home, the TV was already on at mid-morning and would remain on until his girls went to sleep at night. Like most parents with young girls, Golden scrimped and saved for his TV because he wants his girls to stay occupied watching the tube at home rather than play outside. It is far too dangerous for them out there.</p>
<p>The AIDS statistics for Southern Africa are grim. The AIDS Foundation of SA estimates 4.7 million people in their twenties are infected with HIV, or 1 in 9 South Africans. SA is lucky though. In neighboring Botswana, which has the world&#8217;s highest rate of HIV infection, it is an appalling 1 in 3. The gold mining giant, Anglo-American, estimates 30% of its South African workforce is HIV positive. My own employer, BP, is working under the assumption that it will have to replace 20% of its workforce in the near future due to AIDS. These statistics, and the lack of a cure, have led those who are infected to take desperate measures to cure the disease. A folk myth that sex with a virgin cleanses one of HIV has fuelled  an increase in rape, particularly against girls younger than 18, as this myth is accepted as fact by even educated people. (Note that many 19th century Victorians, despite all their emphasis on family values and rectitude similarly believed that sleeping with a virgin would cure them of syphilis, so Westerners shouldn&#8217;t be too smug about this African belief.) As a result, SA now has one of the highest per capita rape and sexual assault cases in the world, and there are shocking headlines of gang rapes being committed on babies as young as 9 months by their own relatives. So you can understand Golden&#8217;s concern for his daughters.</p>
<p>[NOTE: If South Africa has some of the more shocking newspaper headlines I have ever read, it surely has some of the more amusing. My all time favorite newspaper story is one which appeared in the CapeTimes. It seems that for several months nurses at a small hospital in Free State had been baffled to find a dead patient in the same bed every Friday morning. There was no apparent cause for any of the deaths, and extensive checks on the air conditioning system and a search for possible bacterial infection failed to reveal any clues. After enquiring further, however, the mystery was solved. It seems that every Friday morning a cleaner would enter the ward, remove the plug that powered the patient&#8217;s life support system, plug her floor polisher into the vacant socket, then go about her business. When she had finished her chores, she would plug the life support machine back in and leave, unaware that the patient was now dead. She could not, after all, hear the screams and eventual death rattle over the whirring of her polisher. The matter was handled with SA efficiency: a strong letter was sent to the errant cleaner, the hospital in question brought in an electrician to fit an extra socket, and the enquiry was closed. The headline: &#8220;Cleaner Polishes Off Patient.&#8221;]</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Each One Teach One&#8221;: Mandela&#8217;s University</strong></p>
<p>A visit to RobbenIsland&#8211;Mandela&#8217;s old prison was as moving as the township visits. RobbenIsland, or Seal&#8217;s Island, lies about 30 minutes from Capetown by boat. The Dutch started using it in the 1600s as a human rubbish dump for lepers and political prisoners from Indonesia, and it was used by the SA government in a similar capacity (minus the lepers, but with hardened criminals thrown onto the heap) until the end of apartheid in the early 1990s. The unusual feature about this prison is that former inmates, some who spent 30 years locked up, show you around. They tell you how their days went, how the wardens used to get the hardened criminals to brutalize the politicos, and how Mandela decided in a stroke of brilliance that this would be the ANC&#8217;s (African National Congress&#8217;) University. &#8220;Each One Teach One&#8221; was his slogan and so illiterates learned how to read and count in a limestone quarry. Then, through the Red Cross, they got permission to take correspondence courses. The wardens would take books away from prisoners a few weeks before exams on any pretext so it was tough, but hundreds of blacks got degrees this way despite that.  Mandela himself furthered his law studies there, and SA&#8217;s current VP also got his degree while enjoying the hospitality of the SA regime. It is incredible to see this quarry where prisoners were forced to defecate  in a 7x7m pit and then eat in it and think of it as a University, much less that anyone could have conceived that they would one day need the education as they would be running the country. Such is the power of one man&#8217;s dream and vision. It really is a remarkable story. Like the blacks in the townships, the former political prisoners stress forgiveness towards the whites and quote Mandela. He celebrated his 84th B-day while I was there, and the radio and TV was full of blacks and whites calling in with praise for him. One of the first things he did upon becoming President was visit the 85 year old wife of the former President of SA who had jailed him, and even she, a hardened Afrikaner was amazed that someone who she had previously thought of as a terrorist and savage turned out to be so noble and gracious. South Africans have a lot to teach the world in many regards.</p>
<p><strong>Visiting a Witch Doctor&#8211;the Ultimate Remedy for the Transit Lounge Blues</strong></p>
<p>I had a couple of hours to kill at Jo&#8217;burg Airport while waiting for my flight back to the US. Rather than hang around the lounge, I went into the city to the local <em>muti</em> (traditional African medicine shop) where I got a <em>sangoma (</em>witch doctor) to give me a prescription for residual stiffness in my right hand resulting from a decompression hit I took last year after some very deep diving in Grenada and lengthy flying thereafter. Why consult a witch doctor? Firstly, according to Western doctors trained in the fine art of hyperbaric medicine only time <em>might</em> cure this, so I really had nothing to lose. Secondly, I grew up in the Philippines, and got used to my mother bringing me to the local faith healer for complaints that confounded Western medicine. I therefore have a healthy respect for alternative medicine.  Finally, well, it&#8217;s Africa, and I couldn&#8217;t pass up the adventure. </p>
<p>The <em>muti</em> was a little out of place in the middle of bustling Jo&#8217;burg and not exactly doing a brisk business, but otherwise just what you would expect a witch doctor&#8217;s shop to look like&#8211;dark, with various twigs, hides, potions and God knows what else hanging from every nook and cranny. The <em>sangoma,</em> conspicuous in her bracelets and necklaces of white, red and black beads  greeted me from behind her counter, asked what she could do for me and told me how much I would owe her: a princely $8 for consultation and medicine. She then set to work casting four divination tablets of bone on the ground.  These are marked to be distinguished from each other and to tell front from back. They thus can take 2 to the power of 4, or 16 different positions. These positions are interpreted according to several dimensions (ancestors; witchcraft; the body; relations between living kin; wealth; etc.) After consulting her catalogue she proceeded to pound various herbs together in a pestal. Herbology meets I Ching, in other words.</p>
<p> I asked her how she came to be a <em>sangoma</em>. Apparently, a <em>sangoma&#8217;s</em> powers are based on the fact that she (<em>sangomas</em> are usually women) is the incarnation of an ancestral spirit. Usually, the spirit makes itself known by inflicting on the host a serious disease which conventional medicine can&#8217;t heal: my <em>sangoma</em> had a problem with her legs and couldn&#8217;t walk properly. Her grandmother diagnosed her and took her through her <em>sangoma</em> apprenticeship, which she said only lasted a few months. And now she was loose on me!  Gulp! She had me place what looked like ash on my left hand, lick a little, and blow the rest away. Then the same ashy powder was added to some liquid concoction and I was told to drink a cup. Gulp to the power of 10! It was vile. Imagine what sludge a la regurgitated eel juice with a touch of snake liver oil must taste like. Then multiply by a worse factor of about 99%. Ugh! She just laughed  when I asked her if she was sure she remembered her granny&#8217;s recipe correctly, but took pity on me and helped me finish the medicine by drinking what I couldn&#8217;t swallow. Even she grimaced while trying to get this vile potion down, and witch doctor number two sitting in the corner just laughed and laughed. I was then given a Fanta bottle filled with the awful brew, a newspaper full of the ashy stuff, and instructions for continuing my cure. When I thanked witch doctor number one, I was sternly reprimanded by witchdoctor number two for doing so, and was told I was not allowed to say goodbye either. Live and learn. Grand total time in Jo&#8217;burg city itself: 30 minutes. The city does have a bad vibe, but I didn&#8217;t get mugged, not even when riding in the local Honda minivan bus/taxis where they even seat passengers on each other&#8217;s knees and make them each pay the full fare! </p>
<p>I did manage to sneak my Fanta liter bottle of medicine and crushed-ashy-stuff-in-a-newspaper past the US Beagle Patrol, but a house guest I am entertaining refused to let the bitterest brew in America past my lips as the smell from that Fanta bottle was nauseating. Even the Insinkerator steamed up when I poured it out. Still, the witchdoctor was on to something: my hand is almost completely cured now.</p>
